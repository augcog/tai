sections:
- aspects:
  - content: A computer mouse is a hand-controlled electromechanical device designed
      for interacting with a digital computer, particularly those equipped with a
      graphical user interface (GUI). It translates physical movement across a flat
      surface into corresponding cursor movement on the computer display. The mouse
      typically features one or more buttons that allow users to execute commands
      and manipulate on-screen items.
    type: Definition
  - content: Examples of mouse usage include selecting text in a document, activating
      programs by clicking icons, or moving files and folders around the desktop using
      click-and-drag operations. The mouse is essential for tasks requiring precision
      and speed in GUI environments, such as graphic design or gaming.
    type: Examples
  - content: The mouse is widely used in personal computing, office environments,
      and creative industries. It enables intuitive navigation and control in software
      applications, from word processors to complex design tools. Its role is especially
      prominent in operating systems that rely on graphical interfaces, such as Windows,
      macOS, and Linux distributions with desktop environments.
    type: Use Cases
  - content: The invention and adoption of the mouse revolutionized human-computer
      interaction by making computers more accessible and user-friendly. It shifted
      the paradigm from text-based command-line input to direct manipulation of graphical
      elements, paving the way for modern GUIs. The mouse's functionality is closely
      related to other input devices like trackpads and touchscreens, which build
      upon the same principles of direct manipulation.

    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: The primary function of a computer mouse is to translate hand movements
      into cursor movement on a screen, enabling interaction with graphical user interfaces.
      It does not process data, store files, or provide internet connectivity.
    options:
    - Processing data within the computer's CPU
    - Translating hand movements into cursor movement on a screen
    - Storing files and documents
    - Providing wireless internet connectivity
    question_text: Which of the following best describes the primary function of a
      computer mouse?
  index: 150
  key_concept: 'Computer mouse: definition and function'
  name: mouse
- aspects:
  - content: Computer mice are generally classified into mechanical and optical types
      based on how they detect movement. Mechanical mice use a rolling ball that physically
      moves internal sensors, converting the ball's motion into electrical signals
      that control the cursor. Optical mice, in contrast, use a light-emitting diode
      (LED) or laser to detect movement by tracking changes in the surface beneath
      the mouse.
    type: Definition and Mechanisms
  - content: A classic example of a mechanical mouse is the early IBM PC mouse, which
      required regular cleaning of the ball and internal rollers. Modern optical mice,
      such as those produced by Logitech or Microsoft, use infrared LEDs or lasers
      and do not have moving parts, making them more reliable and maintenance-free.
    type: Examples
  - content: Mechanical mice were common in the 1980s and 1990s but have largely been
      replaced by optical mice due to the latter's superior accuracy, lower maintenance,
      and ability to work on a wider range of surfaces. Optical mice are now standard
      in most computing environments, from offices to gaming setups, due to their
      precision and durability.
    type: Use Cases and Practical Implications
  - content: Mechanical mice can struggle with dirt and debris, which can interfere
      with the ball's movement and require frequent cleaning. Optical mice, while
      more robust, may have difficulty tracking on highly reflective or transparent
      surfaces, requiring the use of mouse pads or special surfaces in some cases.
    type: Edge Cases and Limitations
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 0
    explanation: Mechanical mice detect movement using a physical ball, whereas optical
      mice use light sensors (LED or laser). The other options are incorrect as both
      types can be wired or wireless, button count is not determined by type, and
      mechanical mice require more cleaning than optical mice.
    options:
    - Mechanical mice use a ball to detect movement, while optical mice use light
      sensors
    - Mechanical mice are wireless, while optical mice are always wired
    - Mechanical mice have more buttons than optical mice
    - Optical mice require frequent cleaning, while mechanical mice do not
    question_text: What is the main difference between mechanical and optical mice?

  name: mouse
- aspects:
  - content: Mouse input actions refer to the various ways users interact with the
      computer using the mouse's buttons. Clicking involves quickly pressing and releasing
      a button to select or activate items. Clicking and dragging involves holding
      down a button while moving the mouse, allowing users to move objects or select
      multiple items within a graphical user interface.
    type: Definition
  - content: Single-clicking can open files or select icons, while double-clicking
      may launch applications. Clicking and dragging is commonly used to move files
      between folders, highlight text in documents, or draw shapes in graphic design
      programs.
    type: Examples
  - content: These input actions are fundamental to the usability of graphical user
      interfaces, enabling intuitive control and manipulation of digital objects.
      Mastery of clicking and dragging is essential for efficient computer use, especially
      in productivity and creative software. These actions are also foundational for
      accessibility features and alternative input methods, such as touchscreens and
      stylus devices.

  name: mouse
- aspects:
  - content: The computer mouse was invented by American engineer Douglas Engelbart
      in 1963–64 as part of his research into improving human-computer interaction.
      Engelbart's invention was motivated by the need for more efficient ways to interact
      with computers beyond keyboard input, particularly for manipulating graphical
      information.
    type: Historical Context and Definition
  - content: The first mouse prototype, built by Engelbart and his team at the Stanford
      Research Institute, consisted of a wooden shell with two perpendicular metal
      wheels to detect movement. This early device was demonstrated in 'The Mother
      of All Demos' in 1968, showcasing its potential in graphical computing.
    type: Examples and Early Prototypes
  - content: Engelbart's invention laid the groundwork for the widespread adoption
      of graphical user interfaces in personal computing. The mouse became a standard
      input device, fundamentally changing how users interact with computers. Its
      influence extends to the development of related devices, such as trackballs,
      touchpads, and touchscreens, all of which build on the concept of direct manipulation.
