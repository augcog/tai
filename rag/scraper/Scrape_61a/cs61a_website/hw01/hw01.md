# Required Questions

### Q1: A Plus Abs B

Python's `operator` module contains two-argument functions such as `add` and
`sub` for Python's built-in arithmetic operators. For example, `add(2, 3)`
evalutes to 5, just like the expression `2 + 3`.

Fill in the blanks in the following function for adding `a` to the
absolute value of `b`, without calling `abs`. You may **not** modify any
of the provided code other than the two blanks.

```
def a_plus_abs_b(a, b):
    """Return a+abs(b), but without calling abs.

    >>> a_plus_abs_b(2, 3)
    5
    >>> a_plus_abs_b(2, -3)
    5
    >>> a_plus_abs_b(-1, 4)
    3
    >>> a_plus_abs_b(-1, -4)
    3
    """
    if b < 0:
        f = _____
    else:
        f = _____
    return f(a, b)
```

Use Ok to test your code:

```
python3 ok -q a_plus_abs_bCopy✂️
```

 document.getElementById("copy-code-python3ok-qa\_plus\_abs\_b").onclick = () => copyCode('python3 ok -q a\_plus\_abs\_b', "copy-code-python3ok-qa\_plus\_abs\_b");

Use Ok to run the local syntax checker (which checks that you didn't modify any of the provided code other than the two blanks):

```
python3 ok -q a_plus_abs_b_syntax_check
```

### Q2: Two of Three

Write a function that takes three *positive* numbers as arguments and returns
the sum of the squares of the two smallest numbers. **Use only a single line
for the body of the function.**

```
def two_of_three(i, j, k):
    """Return m*m + n*n, where m and n are the two smallest members of the
    positive numbers i, j, and k.

    >>> two_of_three(1, 2, 3)
    5
    >>> two_of_three(5, 3, 1)
    10
    >>> two_of_three(10, 2, 8)
    68
    >>> two_of_three(5, 5, 5)
    50
    """
    return _____

```

> **Hint:** Consider using the `max` or `min` function:
> 
> 
> 
> 
```
> >>> max(1, 2, 3)
> 3
> >>> min(-1, -2, -3)
> -3
> 
```
> 

Use Ok to test your code:

```
python3 ok -q two_of_threeCopy✂️
```

 document.getElementById("copy-code-python3ok-qtwo\_of\_three").onclick = () => copyCode('python3 ok -q two\_of\_three', "copy-code-python3ok-qtwo\_of\_three");

Use Ok to run the local syntax checker (which checks that you used only a single line for the body of the function):

```
python3 ok -q two_of_three_syntax_check
```

### Q3: Largest Factor

Write a function that takes an integer `n` that is **greater than 1** and
returns the largest integer that is smaller than `n` and evenly divides `n`.

```
def largest_factor(n):
    """Return the largest factor of n that is smaller than n.

    >>> largest_factor(15) # factors are 1, 3, 5
    5
    >>> largest_factor(80) # factors are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 40
    40
    >>> largest_factor(13) # factor is 1 since 13 is prime
    1
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

```

> **Hint:** To check if `b` evenly divides `a`,
> use the expression `a % b == 0`, which can be read as,
> "the remainder when dividing `a` by `b` is 0."
> 
> 

Use Ok to test your code:

```
python3 ok -q largest_factorCopy✂️
```

 document.getElementById("copy-code-python3ok-qlargest\_factor").onclick = () => copyCode('python3 ok -q largest\_factor', "copy-code-python3ok-qlargest\_factor");

### Q4: Hailstone

Douglas Hofstadter's Pulitzer-prize-winning book, *Gödel, Escher, Bach*, poses
the following mathematical puzzle.

1. Pick a positive integer `n` as the start.
2. If `n` is even, divide it by 2.
3. If `n` is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
4. Continue this process until `n` is 1.

The number `n` will travel up and down but eventually end at 1 (at least for
all numbers that have ever been tried -- nobody has ever proved that the
sequence will terminate). Analogously, a hailstone travels up and down in the
atmosphere before eventually landing on earth.

This sequence of values of `n` is often called a Hailstone sequence. Write a
function that takes a single argument with formal parameter name `n`, prints
out the hailstone sequence starting at `n`, and returns the number of steps in
the sequence:

```
def hailstone(n):
    """Print the hailstone sequence starting at n and return its
    length.

    >>> a = hailstone(10)
    10
    5
    16
    8
    4
    2
    1
    >>> a
    7
    >>> b = hailstone(1)
    1
    >>> b
    1
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

```

Hailstone sequences can get quite long! Try 27. What's the longest you can
find?

> Note that if `n == 1` initially, then the sequence is one step long.   
> 
> **Hint:** If you see 4.0 but want just 4, try using floor division `//` instead of regular division `/`.
> 
> 

Use Ok to test your code:

```
python3 ok -q hailstoneCopy✂️
```

 document.getElementById("copy-code-python3ok-qhailstone").onclick = () => copyCode('python3 ok -q hailstone', "copy-code-python3ok-qhailstone");
