- aspects:
  - content: This concept refers to Mercedes' campaign to secure second place (P2)
      in the 2025 Formula 1 Teams’ (Constructors’) Championship. The Teams’ Championship
      is determined by the cumulative points scored by both drivers of each team throughout
      the season. In 2025, Mercedes is contending closely with Red Bull, who are 33

      half of the year, has closed the gap, making the battle for P2 highly competitive.

      in a season where they faced strong competition and evolving team dynamics,
