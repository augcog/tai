- aspects:
  - content: The 'papaya rules' refer to McLaren's internal team policy focused on
      providing both drivers with equal opportunity to compete for wins, emphasizing
      fairness and non-preferential treatment. This philosophy is central to McLaren’s
      approach and is set to continue into the 2026 season, despite occasional criticism

    type: Definition and Context
  - content: Examples include instances where equal opportunity led to intra-team
      collisions or strategic miscalculations, such as the Canada clash and Qatar
      strategy error. CEO Zak Brown acknowledged the need to learn from these moments
      but remains committed to the principle. The approach is sometimes debated in
      F1, where other teams may favor a clear number one driver.

  - content: Maintaining the 'papaya rules' aims to foster a harmonious team environment
      and maximize overall performance. For 2026, McLaren’s goals include ironing

      on driver cooperation and adaptability to evolving competitive conditions.
