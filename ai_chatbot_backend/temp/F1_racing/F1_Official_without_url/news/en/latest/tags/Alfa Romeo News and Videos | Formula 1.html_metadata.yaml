- aspects:
  - content: F1 commercial partnerships refer to the formal business relationships
      between Formula 1 and various global brands, companies, and organizations. These
      partnerships are typically structured as sponsorships, official supplier agreements,
      or promotional collaborations, and are a core part of F1's business model.
    type: Definition

      companies (AWS, Lenovo), financial services (American Express, Santander), beverage
      companies (Heineken, Moet Hennessy, PepsiCo), and logistics firms (DHL). Each
      partner's logo is prominently displayed on the F1 website and often at race
      events, on cars, and in broadcast graphics.
    type: Examples
  - content: 'These partnerships provide mutual benefits: F1 gains financial support,
      technological advancements, and enhanced event operations, while partners receive
      global exposure, association with a premium sporting brand, and opportunities
      for unique marketing activations. For instance, AWS provides cloud computing
      for race analytics, while Pirelli supplies official tires.'
