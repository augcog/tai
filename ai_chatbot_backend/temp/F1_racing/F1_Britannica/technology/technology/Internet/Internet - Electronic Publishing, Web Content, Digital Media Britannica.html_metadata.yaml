sections:
- aspects:
  - content: Electronic publishing refers to the production and distribution of books,
      journals, and other content in digital formats, primarily via the Internet.
      The field has evolved rapidly since the early 2000s, with major digitization
      projects such as Google's library initiative making millions of volumes accessible
      online. The transition from print to digital has transformed scholarly publishing,
      making academic journals widely available and searchable, and enabling rapid
      dissemination of research findings.
    type: Definition and Evolution
  - content: Key examples include arXiv.org, an open-access repository for preprints
      in physics, mathematics, and related fields, and the Public Library of Science,
      which publishes peer-reviewed journals freely accessible to the public. Commercial
      initiatives by Microsoft and Amazon have also contributed, with Amazon proposing
      micropayments for digital page access. These platforms facilitate global collaboration
      and immediate access to new research.
    type: Examples and Platforms
  - content: The rise of electronic publishing has democratized access to knowledge,
      enabling the public—including taxpayers who fund research—to access scientific
      findings without paywalls. However, it has also sparked controversies over copyright,
      with authors and publishers concerned about loss of control. The movement toward
      open access has been supported by governments, which require publicly funded
      research to be made freely available. Traditional journal publishers face challenges
      to their business models, as online-only, open-access journals gain prominence.
    type: Implications and Challenges
  - content: Electronic publishing intersects with issues of copyright, open source,
      and academic culture. Unlike other content creators, academics are typically
      unpaid for their publications, and peer review is often voluntary. The shift
      to digital has led to debates over the value of traditional publishing prestige
      versus open dissemination, and has influenced the economics and ethics of academic
      communication.
    type: Connections to Related Concepts

    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: Electronic publishing has enabled rapid and open access to scholarly
      work, making it easier for researchers worldwide to collaborate and stay informed.
      While it has not eliminated copyright concerns, it has significantly increased
      the speed and reach of research dissemination.
    options:
    - It has made most research articles available only to paying subscribers.
    - It has enabled rapid, open access to scholarly work and fostered global collaboration.
    - It has eliminated all concerns over copyright and intellectual property.
    - It has reduced the speed at which new scientific ideas are shared.

      electronic publishing on academic research dissemination?

- aspects:
  - content: Free speech on the Internet refers to the ability of individuals and
      groups to express opinions, share information, and challenge authority through
      digital platforms. The Internet has expanded opportunities for political participation
      and public discourse, especially via blogs and social media, which can bypass
      traditional media gatekeepers.
    type: Definition and Context
  - content: Different countries approach online free speech in distinct ways. For
      example, autocratic regimes like China use extensive censorship mechanisms such
      as the 'Great Firewall' to block undesirable content and monitor user activity.
      Regulations may require users to register with identification and hold service
      providers responsible for hosted content, leading to widespread self-censorship
      and rapid shutdowns of non-compliant sites.
    type: Global Variations and Censorship
  - content: Despite censorship, users often find ways to circumvent restrictions
      using proxy servers or by sharing information through alternative means like
      DVDs. The proliferation of blogs in languages such as Farsi demonstrates how
      citizens can maintain digital public spheres even under repressive conditions.
      These efforts highlight the resilience and adaptability of online communities
      seeking free expression.
    type: Workarounds and Resistance
  - content: The openness of the Internet also allows for the spread of extremist
      or terrorist content. Groups like al-Qaeda have used websites and chat rooms
      for recruitment, communication, and propaganda. However, the public nature of
      these platforms can also expose such groups to infiltration and surveillance
      by authorities.
    type: Risks and Misuse
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 2
    explanation: Authoritarian governments typically do not encourage open discussion
      without monitoring; instead, they use firewalls, require identification, and
      hold providers accountable to control online speech.
    options:
    - Blocking access to certain websites with national firewalls
    - Requiring user identification for Internet access
    - Encouraging open discussion without monitoring
    - Holding service providers responsible for user content
    question_text: Which of the following is NOT a method used by authoritarian governments
      to restrict free speech on the Internet?
  index: 314
  key_concept: Free speech
  name: Free speech
- aspects:
  - content: Political campaigns and muckraking in the Internet era refer to the use
      of digital tools—especially blogs, websites, and online forums—to organize,
      fundraise, and influence public opinion during elections. Muckraking involves
      investigative efforts to expose wrongdoing, often amplified by the viral nature
      of digital media.
    type: Definition and Historical Context
  - content: The 2004 U.S. presidential campaign marked a turning point, with candidates
      like Howard Dean using blogs and websites to mobilize volunteers and raise funds
      through small donations. These innovations were quickly adopted by other candidates
      and parties. Independent groups, enabled by changes in campaign finance law,
      used the Internet to support specific issues and candidates outside traditional
      party structures.
    type: Examples and Innovations
  - content: The Internet has forced politicians to engage with both mainstream media
      and the 'blogosphere,' where unfiltered commentary and rapid feedback can shape
      campaign narratives. Scandals and fact-checking by bloggers have increased public
      skepticism and pressured traditional media to address stories they might otherwise
      overlook. The lines between media types have blurred as newspapers adopt digital
      features like editorial blogs and reader forums.
    type: Implications for Political Communication
  - content: While some predict that blogs and online news will replace traditional
      media, it is more likely that diverse sources will coexist and complement each
      other. The Internet's participatory nature has democratized campaign communication,
      but also introduced challenges in verifying information and maintaining civil
      discourse.
    type: Ongoing Debates and Future Trends

    - It made television the primary campaign tool.
    - It enabled candidates to fundraise and organize supporters online, and allowed
      independent groups to mobilize outside traditional party structures.
    - It eliminated the need for any campaign finance laws.
