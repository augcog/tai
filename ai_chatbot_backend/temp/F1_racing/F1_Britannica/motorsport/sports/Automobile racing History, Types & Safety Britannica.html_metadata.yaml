  name: automobile racing
- aspects:
  - content: Automobile racing began shortly after the invention of the gasoline-powered
      internal-combustion engine in the 1880s. The first organized competition was
      a reliability test in 1894 from Paris to Rouen, followed by the first true race
      from Paris to Bordeaux and back in 1895. Racing quickly spread to the United
      States, with an early race from Chicago to Evanston in 1895. Early European
      races were often town-to-town events, but safety concerns led to the rise of
      closed-circuit road races by the late 1890s.
    type: chronological development
  - content: Key early events included the Bennett Trophy races (1901-1905), organized
      by the Automobile Club de France and later held in various European locations.
      The French Grand Prix was established in 1906 after French manufacturers boycotted
      the Bennett Trophy. The Targa Florio in Sicily and the Vanderbilt Cup in the
      United States were other prominent early races. Influential figures included
      James Gordon Bennett, who sponsored international competition, and William K.
      Vanderbilt, who established a major American trophy.
    type: notable events and figures
  - content: Early races often featured prototype cars that previewed next year's
      production models, but over time, racing cars became increasingly specialized.
      After World War I, the use of production cars declined in favor of purpose-built
      racing vehicles. Governing bodies like the Automobile Club de France and, later,
      the FIA, played key roles in standardizing rules and promoting safety.
    type: technological and regulatory evolution
  - content: The early history of automobile racing set the stage for modern motorsport,
      establishing traditions of international competition, technological innovation,
      and regulatory oversight. The shift from open-road races to closed circuits
      reflected growing concerns for safety, influencing the structure of contemporary
      racing. Early events like the Mille Miglia and the French Grand Prix remain
      iconic in the sport's legacy.

- aspects:
  - content: Speedway racing refers to automobile races held on purpose-built tracks,
      typically oval in shape and often banked for higher speeds. The first such track
      was Brooklands, constructed in 1906 in Surrey, England, featuring a 4.45 km
      circuit with banked curves. Speedway racing developed as a safer and more controlled
      alternative to open-road racing.
    type: definition and origins
  - content: Notable speedways include Brooklands (England), Monza (Italy), Montlhéray
      (France), and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (United States). Brooklands hosted
      various race formats, including sprints, endurance runs, and 24-hour events,
      until its closure in 1939. The Indianapolis 500, first run in 1911, is among
      the most famous speedway events and has continued except during wartime.
    type: major venues and events
  - content: Speedway tracks are characterized by their oval or circular layouts,
      wide surfaces, and banked curves, which allow for higher speeds and improved
      safety. Early tracks like Brooklands and Monza influenced the design of later
      circuits worldwide. Some tracks, such as Montlhéray, were also used for setting
      speed records and included road circuit sections for Grand Prix racing.
    type: track design and innovations
  - content: The rise of speedway racing marked a shift toward spectator-friendly,
      controlled environments that could accommodate large audiences and fostered
      the growth of professional motorsport. The popularity of speedways in the United
      States led to the proliferation of board and dirt tracks, especially in the
      1920s. Speedway racing remains a central aspect of automobile racing culture,
      with iconic events and venues continuing to shape the sport.
