sections:
- aspects:
  - content: Television is a form of mass media that electronically transmits moving
      images and sound from a source to a receiver, enabling the extension of vision
      and hearing beyond physical distance. It is distinguished by its ability to
      deliver both visual and auditory information simultaneously, setting it apart
      from earlier media like radio and print.
    type: Definition
  - content: Television has had a profound influence on society by shaping public
      opinion, disseminating news and entertainment, and fostering a shared cultural
      experience. Its reach has made it a central medium for education, interpersonal
      communication, and the global spread of popular culture, particularly American
      culture in the 20th and 21st centuries.
    type: Societal Influence
  - content: 'Television content is delivered through multiple platforms: terrestrial
      radio waves (broadcast TV), coaxial cables (cable TV), geostationary satellites
      (direct broadcast satellite TV), internet streaming, and digital video discs
      (DVDs, Blu-ray). Each method has its own technological and infrastructural requirements,
      influencing accessibility and audience reach.'
    type: Modes of Delivery
  - content: Originally conceived in the early 20th century as a tool for education
      and communication, television quickly evolved into a mass broadcast medium.
      Its technical standards for monochrome and color transmission were established
      mid-20th century, with ongoing improvements such as high-definition television
      (HDTV) and digital transmission.

    explanation: The article emphasizes television's role in extending sensory perception
      and shaping global society and culture, not just local entertainment or exclusive
      uses.
    options:
    - It only provided entertainment to local audiences.
    - It extended vision and hearing beyond physical distance, influencing society
      and culture globally.
    - It was initially used exclusively for military communications.
    - It replaced all other forms of media immediately after its invention.
    question_text: Which of the following best describes the primary societal impact
      of television as discussed in the article?
  index: 211
  key_concept: Definition and Societal Impact of Television
  name: television
- aspects:
  - content: The idea of seeing distant places has ancient roots, reflected in mythology
      and literature, but only became technically feasible in the late 19th and early
      20th centuries. Early thinkers and inventors sought ways to transmit images
      over distances, inspired by advances in telegraphy and the desire for remote
      vision.
    type: Historical Dream and Conceptualization
  - content: A pivotal moment occurred in 1872 when Joseph May discovered that selenium
      wire's conductivity varied with light exposure, providing the groundwork for
      converting light into electrical signals. This principle is fundamental to all
      subsequent television technology.
    type: Key Discoveries
  - content: Maurice LeBlanc, in 1880, proposed a scanning mechanism to exploit the
      retina's persistence of vision, suggesting a photoelectric cell could scan an
      image line by line, transmitting brightness information sequentially. This scanning
      concept allowed for the transmission of an entire image via a single channel
      and remains foundational in television.
    type: Scanning Principle
  - content: LeBlanc's system envisioned synchronized transmitter and receiver operations,
      reconstructing the image line by line at the destination. This idea of synchronization
      is crucial for accurate image reproduction and is a core principle in all television
      systems.
    type: Transmission and Synchronization
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: LeBlanc's concept of scanning an image line by line and synchronizing
      transmitter and receiver forms the basis of all television systems, enabling
      the transmission of complex images over a single channel.
    options:
    - Color encoding
    - Image scanning and synchronization
    - Wireless audio transmission
    - Satellite broadcasting
    question_text: What key technical principle introduced by Maurice LeBlanc underpins
      all television systems?
  index: 211
  key_concept: Early Technical Foundations of Television
  name: television
- aspects:
  - content: Paul Nipkow invented the scanning disk in 1884, a rotating disk with
      spiral holes that allowed sequential scanning of an image. Each revolution of
      the disk corresponded to a complete scan, breaking the image into lines and
      enabling transmission through a single electrical channel.
    type: Nipkow Disk and Scanning
  - content: John Logie Baird in Britain and Charles Francis Jenkins in the United
      States were pioneers who built working mechanical television systems based on
      the Nipkow disk. Baird achieved the first live human face transmission in 1925,
      marking a significant milestone in television history.
    type: Early Implementations
  - content: By the late 1920s, companies like AT&T and General Electric conducted
      public demonstrations and began regular broadcasts using mechanical systems.
      Jenkins sold television kits and established a station, while Baird produced
      shows for the BBC, sparking the first 'television boom.'
    type: Public Demonstrations and Broadcasts
  - content: Mechanical televisions produced low-resolution, flickering images and
      were met with skepticism and ridicule by many. Despite technical and perceptual
      limitations, these early systems laid the groundwork for future electronic television
      developments.
