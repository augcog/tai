Is the journal club a part of \"1 hour of organized paper-reading time in lab sections.\" mentioned in the website policy, Or if that week has a formal Lab, and there will not be any journal club?\n\nAre they mandatory and held weekly? Because I have a class end at 10:15 once every four weeks on Thursday, I want to know if I could be a little bit late for about 15 min once every four weeks at the journal club when I signing up for it. \n\nThanks!\n\n",
        "answer": "Hi! Sorry about the confusion! The journal club is the 1 hour of organized paper-reading time. There's no other synchronous/in-person component of lab. Working on projects is done on your own time.\n\nThey are mandatory and they are held weekly.\n\nAs far as your conflict, I'd encourage you to choose a different section than the 10 am one, since coming late will not be great (defeats the entire purpose since it's only an hour-long meeting). Plus if you factor in the time it takes for you to walk from your class, you'd be missing half the meeting. On the other hand, since it's only every four weeks, it's probably okay -- you'd have to get it excused by whoever your Lab TA is, and make sure that you're not presenting on any of those days. But it's better for everyone if you prioritize a section you can always make it to, barring any extenuating circumstances. \n\n",

In the solution I don't see where condition 2 is being met or why we are proving that v >= 0 since 0 is not a function that is strictly increasing and based on the magnitude of x. On an earlier example, we proved LPD by proving that v(x,t) was greater than a function e.v min * magnitude of x^2 but I don't see where this applies to this solution.

        "answer": "This question is more about taking the algebraic equation h(q) = 0 and arriving at an expression for q_n ddot. Since h(q) = 0 is an algebraic constraint, we can find another function, say h_2(q1, ..., qn-1) such that h_2(q1, ..., qn-1) = qn. This process is essentially isolating one of the variables in your algebraic constraint. At this point, you can use h_2 to arrive at an expression for q_n ddot.\n\n\n\nThe system's Lagrangian dynamics provides us with a set of differential equations such that we can solve for q_1 to q_n-1 (this is given by the problem). This problem is stating that given the values these variables must take on, we can completely determine q_n ddot. At a high level, this means that q_n ddot \"isn't special\" -- it's determined by the rest of its buddies (q1, ..., qn-1). That is, we lose a degree of freedom. ",

The desired wrench isn't a separate function but simply the mass of the object times a 6x1 array that accounts for gravity. \n\nFor sample around vertices, you can use np.random.normal and pass in some params to offset a new_vertices array that you can generate through find_grasp_vertices (a util function, you'll have to pass in the object mesh).

        "question": "I understand that convolution is cross correlation (sliding the filter over the image) with a flipped filter across the x and y axes. However, I am a bit confused by the indexing. In 1.1, we take both indexes from [-N, N]. But the underlying F is a Numpy array with positive indices. Do we assume that (-N, -N) in the filter math notation corresponds to (0, 0) in the Numpy array?",
        "answer": "Yeah, see my answer below - it should be $I(x+i, y+j)$.",
