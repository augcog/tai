  - content: Self-healing tires refer to a new class of pneumatic tires engineered
      with materials or structures that can automatically repair minor punctures or
      damage. This innovation is achieved through advancements in rubber chemistry
      and the incorporation of self-sealing compounds or microcapsules that release
      sealing agents when the tire is compromised.
    type: Definition
  - content: A video from the American Chemical Society demonstrates how scientists
      have designed tires that can seal themselves after being punctured, preventing
      air loss and maintaining tire integrity. For instance, a nail puncture in such
      a tire would trigger the release of a sealant, closing the hole almost instantly.
