1. (7.0 points) What Would Python Display? Assume the following code has been executed. The Link class appears on the midterm 2 study guide (page 2, left side). def shake(it): if it is not Link.empty and it.rest is not Link.empty: if it.first + 1 < it.rest.first: it.rest = Link(it.rest.first-1, it.rest) shake(it) else: shake(it.rest) it = Link(2, Link(5, Link(7))) off = Link(1, it.rest) shake(it) def cruel(summer): while summer is not Link.empty: yield summer.first summer = summer.rest if summer is not Link.empty: summer = summer.rest summer = Link(1, Link(2, Link(3, Link(4)))) Write the output printed for each expression below or _Error_ if an error occurs. 1. (2.0 pt) print(it) <2 5 7> <2 4 5 7> <2 4 5 6 7> <2 3 4 5 7> <2 4 3 5 7> <2 3 4 5 6 7> <2 4 3 5 6 7> (2.0 pt) print(off) <1 5 6 7> (2.0 pt) print([x*x for x in cruel(summer)]) [1, 9]

**(d) (1.0 pt)** What is the order of growth of the time it takes to evaluate shake(Link(1, Link(n))) in terms of n?
