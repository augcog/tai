- aspects:
  - content: Cable television refers to any system that distributes television signals
      via coaxial or fibre-optic cables, and can also include systems that distribute
      signals solely via satellite. It is commonly known as community antenna television
      (CATV), where a central antenna receives broadcast signals and retransmits them
      to subscribers through a cable network.
    type: Definition
  - content: Cable television originated in the United States in the late 1940s, primarily
      to improve the reception of commercial network broadcasts in areas where over-the-air
      signals were weak due to geographic obstacles like hills or distance. By the
      1960s, cable systems expanded into metropolitan areas to address signal degradation
      caused by reflections from tall buildings.
    type: Historical Context
  - content: Early cable systems served remote rural communities and urban locations
      with poor broadcast reception. Subscribers paid installation and monthly service
      fees for access to improved signal quality and additional channels.
    type: Examples and Use Cases
  - content: Cable television is closely linked to the broader development of television
      technology and communications infrastructure, and its evolution reflects changes
      in both technology and media consumption patterns.
