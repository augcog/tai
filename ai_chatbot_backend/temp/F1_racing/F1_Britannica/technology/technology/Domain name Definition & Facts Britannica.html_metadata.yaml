  explanation: Domain names are mapped to IP addresses, and URLs incorporate domain
    names to indicate the specific location of resources on the Internet.
  knowledge_areas:
  - Domain Name Structure and Function
  options:
  - Domain names are a type of IP address, while URLs are unrelated.
  - Domain names are mapped to IP addresses, and URLs use domain names to specify
    resource locations.
  - IP addresses are mapped to URLs, and domain names are not involved.
  - URLs are only used for email addresses, not web addresses.

sections:
- aspects:
  - content: A domain name is the address of a computer, organization, or other entity
      on the Internet. It serves as a human-readable identifier that is mapped to
      an IP address, allowing users to access resources online without memorizing
      numerical IP addresses.
    type: Definition
  - content: 'Domain names are typically organized in a hierarchical, three-level
      format: ''server.organization.type.'' The top-level domain (TLD) usually indicates
      the type of organization (e.g., ''com'' for commercial, ''edu'' for educational).
      The second level combines the TLD with the organization''s name (e.g., ''britannica.com''),
      while the third level specifies a particular host server (e.g., ''www'' in ''www.britannica.com'').'
    type: Structure
  - content: Each domain name must be unique on the Internet and is ultimately mapped
      to an IP address. However, it is possible for multiple domain names to map to
      the same IP address, enabling different domain names to point to the same server
      or website. This mapping is essential for routing Internet traffic and providing
      distinct online identities.
    type: Mapping and Uniqueness
  - content: Domain names must be assigned by registrars accredited by the Internet
      Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), ensuring global uniqueness
      and proper management. ICANN is responsible for overseeing the domain name system
      and has expanded the number of available TLDs to accommodate diverse needs and
      languages.
    type: Assignment and Regulation
  - content: In 2011, ICANN announced a significant expansion of TLDs, allowing for
      nearly any new top-level domain name in any language, reflecting the growing
      complexity and globalization of the Internet. Domain names are closely related
      to URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), which specify the exact location of resources
      on the Internet, and to IP addresses, which are the numerical counterparts to
      domain names.

  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: Option 2 is correct because domain names must be unique and are assigned
      by registrars accredited by ICANN. Option 1 is incorrect because domain names
      are human-readable addresses, not numerical IP addresses. Option 3 is incorrect
      because TLDs usually indicate type of organization, not geographic location.
      Option 4 is incorrect because multiple domain names can map to the same IP address.
    options:
    - A domain name is a numerical address used directly by computers to route Internet
      traffic.
    - Each domain name must be unique and is assigned by an ICANN-accredited registrar.
    - The top-level domain always indicates the geographic location of the server.
    - Multiple domain names cannot point to the same IP address.
