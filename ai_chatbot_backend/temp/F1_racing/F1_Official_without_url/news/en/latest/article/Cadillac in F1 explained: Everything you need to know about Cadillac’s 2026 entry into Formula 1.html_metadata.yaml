  - content: 'Cadillac, backed by General Motors and TWG Motorsports, is set to become
      Formula 1’s 11th team in 2026, marking the first all-new team entry since Haas
      in 2016. The team will be officially known as the Cadillac Formula 1 Team and
      will have dual headquarters: their primary base in Fishers, Indiana (near Indianapolis),
      and a UK facility adjacent to Silverstone. This structure mirrors other international
      F1 teams, balancing American roots with European motorsport proximity.'
    type: Definition and Overview
  - content: Cadillac’s entry comes at a time of significant technical regulation
      changes in F1, positioning them to build their team around the new rules from
      the outset. Their American identity is emphasized, making them the second US-registered
      team after Haas. Like Haas, Cadillac will operate with multiple global facilities,
      including a new power unit center in Charlotte, North Carolina, to support future
      ambitions.
    type: Examples and Context
  - content: The addition of Cadillac increases the grid to 11 teams, expanding F1’s
      American presence and potentially boosting the sport’s popularity in the US.
      Their dual-base approach is strategically significant, enabling logistical efficiency
      for the European-centric race calendar while maintaining a strong US brand identity.
      Their entry also coincides with Audi’s 2026 debut, though Audi is evolving from
      the existing Sauber team rather than entering as a brand-new entity.

      engineering expertise.
    type: Definition and Roles
  - content: The leadership team brings a wealth of experience from various F1 teams
      and projects, which is vital for a new team facing the sport’s steep learning
      curve. For example, Lowdon’s experience with Marussia prepares him for the unique
      challenges of a new entrant, while Chester and Symonds have been involved in
      technical and regulatory changes, which is crucial given the 2026 regulation
      overhaul.

- aspects:
  - content: For their debut, Cadillac has signed experienced F1 drivers Valtteri
      Bottas and Sergio Perez to multi-year contracts, providing the team with a wealth
      of racecraft and technical feedback. The combined experience of both drivers
      includes 527 Grand Prix starts, 16 wins, and 23 pole positions. Additionally,
      Colton Herta, an American IndyCar winner, has been appointed as the team’s test
      driver, with plans to compete in Formula 2 to prepare for a potential F1 future.
    type: Definition and Overview
  - content: Both Bottas and Perez spent the 2025 season on the sidelines, making
      their return with Cadillac a significant storyline. Their selection reflects
      Cadillac’s priority on proven talent over nationality for their inaugural season,
      despite the team’s American identity. Herta’s move to F2 is a strategic step
      to gain the necessary experience and super license points required for F1, demonstrating
      Cadillac’s commitment to developing American talent for the long term.
    type: Examples and Context
  - content: The choice of experienced drivers is intended to stabilize the team’s
      performance and development in its critical early years. Cadillac’s stated goal
      of creating a pathway for American drivers aligns with broader efforts to increase
      US representation in F1, but immediate competitiveness takes precedence. This
      dual focus on experience and future potential mirrors strategies seen in other
      new teams.
    type: Implications and Connections
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:

    explanation: Cadillac prioritized experience for their debut by selecting Bottas
      and Perez, both accomplished F1 veterans. Colton Herta is being developed as
      a future American F1 driver, initially serving as a test driver and racing in
      F2 to gain experience.
    options:
    - To prioritize American drivers from the start.
    - Because both drivers bring extensive F1 experience, while Herta is being developed
      as a future American F1 prospect.
    - Due to a lack of available drivers.
    - Because both Bottas and Perez were already driving for Cadillac in IndyCar.

    1'
- aspects:
  - content: Cadillac plans to become a full works team, producing both their own
      chassis and power unit. However, for their initial seasons (2026-2028), they
      will use Ferrari-supplied power units and gearboxes, similar to the arrangements
      of Haas and Ferrari. Their long-term goal is to debut a Cadillac/General Motors
      power unit by 2029, with a dedicated facility under construction near GM’s technical
      center in Charlotte.
    type: Definition and Overview
  - content: The use of Ferrari power units is a pragmatic choice for a new team,
      allowing Cadillac to focus on building operational and chassis expertise before
      developing a proprietary engine. This mirrors the approach taken by other new
      entrants, such as Haas, who also relied on Ferrari technology in their formative
      years. The timeline for Cadillac’s in-house engine aligns with the typical multi-year
      development cycles required for competitive F1 power units.
    type: Examples and Context
  - content: This staged approach reduces technical risk and accelerates Cadillac’s
      entry into F1. It also positions them to benefit from Ferrari’s proven technology
      while developing their own capabilities. The eventual transition to a full works
      team is significant, as it allows for greater integration and performance optimization,
      a model followed by top teams like Mercedes and Red Bull.

- aspects:
  - content: Cadillac’s initial target for their F1 debut is to execute operations
      effectively and earn respect from competitors, rather than setting specific
      performance goals. Team Principal Graeme Lowdon emphasizes the importance of
      building a solid foundation and gaining credibility within the paddock. Long-term,
      the team aspires to establish itself as a competitive and enduring presence
      in Formula 1.
    type: Definition and Overview
  - content: Lowdon’s approach reflects lessons from previous new entrants, focusing
      first on operational excellence and integration before aiming for podiums or
      championships. Bottas’s statement that 'the sky’s the limit' for Cadillac underscores
      the team’s ambition to grow into a significant force over time. Their measured
      approach is contrasted with the pitfalls experienced by past new teams that
      set unrealistic short-term targets.
    type: Examples and Context
  - content: This philosophy reduces pressure on immediate results and prioritizes
      sustainable team growth. It also aligns with F1’s competitive reality, where
