sections:
- aspects:
  - content: Cloud computing is a method of running application software and storing
      related data in centralized computer systems, which are accessed by users over
      the Internet. This approach contrasts with traditional computing, where applications
      and data are stored locally on users' personal computers or organizational servers.
      Cloud computing enables on-demand access to computing resources, allowing for
      greater scalability, flexibility, and resource sharing.
    type: definition
  - content: Examples of cloud computing include using web-based email services, online
      document editing platforms, and media streaming services, all of which store
      data and run applications on remote servers rather than on the user's device.
      Businesses may use cloud-based customer relationship management tools, while
      individuals might use cloud storage for personal photos or files.
    type: examples
  - content: The shift to cloud computing has significant implications for both individuals
      and organizations, including reduced need for local IT infrastructure, potential
      cost savings, and increased access to advanced technologies. However, it also
      introduces new challenges such as dependency on Internet connectivity, data
      security, and privacy concerns.

    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: Cloud computing is defined as accessing applications and data stored
      on centralized servers via the Internet, not just on local computers or through
      peer-to-peer networks.
    options:
    - Running applications and storing data on local computers only.
    - Accessing applications and data stored on central servers via the Internet.
    - Using only open-source software for business operations.
    - Transferring data exclusively through peer-to-peer networks.
    question_text: Which of the following best describes cloud computing?
  index: 144
  key_concept: cloud computing
  name: cloud computing
- aspects:
  - content: The concept of cloud computing has roots in the mainframe time-sharing
      systems of the 1960s and 1970s, where multiple users accessed centralized computing
      resources remotely. The term itself became popular in 2008, but the foundational
      ideas predate this by several decades. Early visions, such as those described
      by Douglas F. Parkhill in 1966, likened computing to a public utility, foreseeing
      widespread remote access to centralized computing power.
    type: historical context
  - content: Efforts to establish large-scale computer utilities were initially limited
      by the capacity of telecommunications networks, making it more practical for
      organizations to maintain their own computing infrastructure. It was not until
      the expansion of high-capacity fibre-optic networks in the 1990s that these
      limitations began to be overcome, enabling the rise of remote computing services.
    type: technological constraints
  - content: In the late 1990s, application service providers (ASPs) emerged, offering
      applications over the Internet. While most early ASPs failed, their model laid
      the groundwork for what would later be known as cloud computing, as the practice
      of supplying applications remotely became more feasible and widely adopted.
    type: evolution of service models
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 2
    explanation: The expansion of high-capacity fibre-optic networks in the 1990s
      removed key telecommunications constraints, making large-scale remote computing
      practical.
    options:
    - Development of personal computers
    - Invention of the smartphone
    - Expansion of high-capacity fibre-optic networks
    - Rise of open-source software
    question_text: What major technological advancement in the 1990s enabled the practical
      development of cloud computing?
  index: 265
  key_concept: Early development
  name: Early development
- aspects:
  - content: 'Cloud computing encompasses several service models: Software as a Service
      (SaaS) delivers discrete applications to users (e.g., accounting or photo-sharing
      apps); Hardware as a Service (HaaS) or utility/grid computing provides processing
      power and storage for users to run their own applications; and Platform as a
      Service (PaaS) offers remote computing capacity along with development tools
      for software programmers. These models cater to both business and consumer markets.'
    type: service models
  - content: Early and major cloud computing providers include Salesforce.com (business
      applications), Google (Google Apps for consumers and businesses), and Amazon
      Web Services (AWS), which provides infrastructure for developers and companies.
      Other significant players are Microsoft, Apple, Intuit, and Oracle, all of which
      have introduced their own cloud-based offerings. Social networks like Facebook,
      Twitter, and MySpace also rely heavily on cloud infrastructure.
    type: major providers
  - content: Cloud service providers may charge users through subscriptions or usage
      fees, or offer free services supported by advertising revenue. The lower profitability
      of cloud services compared to traditional software and hardware sales poses
      a strategic challenge for established computing companies, potentially threatening
      their traditional business models.

    explanation: Peer-to-Peer as a Service (P2PaaS) is not a recognized cloud computing
      service model, while SaaS, PaaS, and HaaS are established categories.
    options:
    - Software as a Service (SaaS)
    - Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    - Hardware as a Service (HaaS)
    - Peer-to-Peer as a Service (P2PaaS)
    question_text: Which of the following is NOT a typical model of cloud computing
      service?
  index: 282
  key_concept: Cloud services and major providers
  name: Cloud services and major providers
- aspects:
  - content: Cloud computing relies on massive data centres, often requiring investments
      of hundreds of millions of dollars. These centres house thousands of networked
      server computers, frequently organized into parallel-processing or grid-computing
      systems. Advanced virtualization technologies are used to divide physical machines
      into multiple virtual machines, which can be rented to customers as needed.
    type: infrastructure
  - content: Due to their high electricity consumption, data centres are often situated
      near sources of cheap and abundant power, such as hydroelectric dams. This strategic
      placement helps manage operational costs and environmental impact.
    type: energy and location considerations
  - content: The centralization of sensitive personal and commercial data in third-party
      data centres raises significant privacy and security concerns, including risks
      related to unauthorized access, data breaches, and the transmission of data
      across national borders. There are also fears about the emergence of data monopolies
      or oligopolies, prompting calls for increased government regulation similar
      to that of other public utilities.
    type: privacy and regulatory concerns
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: A key privacy concern is the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive
      data stored in centralized, third-party data centres.
    options:
    - The high cost of electricity
    - Unauthorized access to centralized personal or commercial data
    - Limited scalability of virtual machines
