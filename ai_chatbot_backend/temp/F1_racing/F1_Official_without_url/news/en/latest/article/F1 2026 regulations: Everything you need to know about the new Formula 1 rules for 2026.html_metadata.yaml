- aspects:
  - content: Active Aero refers to the new system allowing drivers to adjust the angle
      of both front and rear wing elements dynamically depending on track position.
      This replaces the traditional DRS, enabling all drivers to enter a low-drag
      mode on designated straights, regardless of their position relative to other
      cars.
    type: Definition
  - content: In corners, wing flaps remain closed for maximum grip, but on straights,
      drivers can open the flaps to reduce drag and increase top speed. Additionally,
      drivers now have access to Overtake Mode (extra electrical energy when within
      one second of a rival) and a Boost button (maximum power from engine and battery
      for attack or defense).
    type: Examples
  - content: Active Aero can be used by any driver on every lap, making overtaking
      and defending more strategic. Overtake Mode is only available when within one
      second of a competitor, while the Boost button can be used at any time, provided
      there is enough battery charge.
    type: Use Cases
  - content: These tools give drivers greater tactical flexibility and make races
      more dynamic. The removal of traditional DRS and the introduction of universal
      Active Aero aim to equalize overtaking opportunities. The integration of these
      tools with energy management systems connects closely with the new power unit
      rules.

- aspects:
  - content: The 2026 regulations retain the 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrid but shift the
      power balance towards a roughly 50-50 split between internal combustion and
      electric power. The electric motor output is tripled, and the Energy Recovery
      System (ERS) can now recover twice as much energy per lap. The MGU-H component
      is removed to simplify the system and improve road relevance.
    type: Definition
  - content: Manufacturers like Ferrari, Mercedes, Red Bull Powertrains (with Ford),
      Audi, Honda, and General Motors are all engaged or attracted by these changes.
      The ERS now recovers energy not only under braking but also when lifting off
      the throttle, and drivers can select different recharge modes in collaboration
      with their race engineers.
    type: Examples
  - content: These changes make the power units more relevant to road car technology
      and reduce costs and complexity. The greater reliance on electric power and
      simplified hybrid systems are expected to attract more manufacturers and foster
      innovation.
