    question_text: Which statement best describes the evolution of the telephone instrument
      since Bell's patent?
  index: 205
  key_concept: The telephone instrument
  name: telephone
- aspects:
  - content: 'The telephone instrument consists of several key functional components:
      a power source, switch hook, dialer, ringer, transmitter, receiver, and anti-sidetone
      circuit. Each component plays a specific role in enabling the telephone to transmit
      and receive voice signals effectively.'
    type: definition and list
  - content: For example, early telephones used batteries within the instrument as
      the power source, while later designs used current from the local switching
      office. The switch hook, originally a physical hook, evolved into a cradle and,
      in modern devices, into electronic relays. Cordless phones reintroduced individual
      batteries, reflecting adaptation to new use cases.
    type: examples and technical evolution
  - content: Understanding these components is crucial for grasping how telephones
      function and how innovations—such as microcircuitry, cordless technology, and
      electronic switching—have built upon and refined the basic architecture. These
      components also connect to larger systems, such as the public switched telephone
      network.
