sections:
- aspects:
  - content: Military technology refers to the range of weapons, equipment, structures,
      and vehicles specifically designed and used for warfare. It encompasses not
      only the physical objects themselves but also the knowledge required to construct,
      employ, repair, and replenish them. This includes both the hardware and the
      systems of operation and logistics that support their use in combat.
    type: Definition
  - content: 'The technology of war is commonly divided into five categories: offensive
      arms (designed to harm the enemy), defensive weapons (to ward off attacks),
      transportation technology (for moving soldiers and materiel), communications
      (to coordinate armed forces), and sensors (to detect and guide forces and weaponry).
      Each category plays a distinct role in the overall effectiveness of military
      operations.'
    type: Categories
  - content: Examples of military technology range from ancient swords, shields, and
      chariots to modern tanks, aircraft, missiles, and cyberwarfare tools. Communication
      devices such as radios and encrypted messaging systems, as well as sensors like
      radar and night vision, illustrate the breadth of the field. The article also
      references the importance of vehicles like tanks and aircraft in modern warfare.
    type: Examples
  - content: The development and deployment of military technology have profound implications
      for the conduct of war, influencing tactics, strategy, and even the psychological
      cohesion of military units. The effectiveness of military technology often determines
      the outcome of conflicts and shapes the balance of power between states.
    type: Implications
  - content: Military technology is closely linked to other fields such as general
      technology, engineering, logistics, and even social sciences like economics
      and law. It also shares principles with nonmilitary applications, such as energy
      conversion, explosives manufacturing, and communication systems.

    explanation: The article defines military technology as encompassing not just
      weapons, but also vehicles, communications, sensors, and the knowledge required
      for their use and maintenance. It is broader than just offensive arms or adapted
      civilian technologies.
    options:
    - Only weapons used in direct combat
    - All weapons, vehicles, communication systems, and supporting knowledge used
      for warfare
    - Civilian transportation technology adapted for war
    - Only offensive arms such as guns and missiles
    question_text: Which of the following best describes the scope of military technology
      as defined in the article?
  index: 241
  key_concept: Definition and Scope of Military Technology
  name: military technology
- aspects:
  - content: There is a critical relationship between military technology, the tactics
      used in warfare, and the psychological cohesion of military units. Technology
      shapes the ways armies fight, while tactics are the methods employed to use
      technology effectively. Cohesion refers to the psychological forces that bind
      soldiers together, enabling coordinated action.
    type: Definition
  - content: 'The Greek hoplite phalanx is cited as a positive example: their arms
      and armor promoted close formation fighting, which required and reinforced unit
      cohesion. In contrast, late medieval knights, with their heavy armor and individualistic
      fighting style, often lacked effective communication and cohesion, leading to
      tactical disadvantages against more unified opponents.'
    type: Examples
  - content: The effectiveness of military units depends not just on the quality of
      their technology, but on how well that technology supports coordinated tactics
      and group cohesion. Poorly integrated technology can undermine unit effectiveness,
      while technology that enhances communication and collective action can be a
      force multiplier.
    type: Implications
  - content: This relationship ties military technology to broader concepts in military
      science, such as strategy, tactics, and logistics. It also connects to psychological
      and sociological studies of group behavior under stress.

    explanation: The article explains that hoplite arms and armor were suited for
      close formation fighting, enhancing cohesion, while knights' technology led
      to more individualistic combat and poor communication.
    options:
    - Hoplite technology promoted close formation and cohesion; knight technology
      encouraged individual fighting.
    - Both promoted individual combat styles.
    - Knights had better communication due to their armor.
    - Hoplites fought individually, while knights used group tactics.
    question_text: How did military technology influence the cohesion and tactics
      of ancient Greek hoplites compared to late medieval knights?
  index: 241
  key_concept: Relationship Between Technology, Tactics, and Cohesion
  name: military technology
- aspects:
  - content: The diffusion of military technology refers to how innovations spread
      across regions and cultures. Historically, this process was slow and uneven
      due to limitations in transportation, economic resources, and the overall level
      of technological development.
    type: Definition
  - content: Key factors included slow and limited transport, low agricultural and
      economic development (leaving little surplus for military investment), and a
      heavy reliance on human muscle power. Geography, climate, and topography also
      played significant roles in shaping both technology and tactics.
    type: Factors Affecting Diffusion
  - content: Distinct military technologies developed in separate regions such as
      Mesoamerica, Japan, India–Southeast Asia, China, and Europe. For example, the
      Eurasian Steppe developed a unique system based on horse archers and the composite
      recurved bow.
    type: Examples
  - content: The slow diffusion of technology led to the creation of 'military ecospheres,'
      or regions with unique military systems adapted to local conditions. The eventual
      breakdown of these barriers, especially with advances in transportation and
      gunpowder weapons, led to the dominance of European military methods.
    type: Implications
  - content: This concept connects to world history, the study of technological innovation,
      and the impact of geography on societal development. It also relates to the
      eventual globalization of military technology and the rise of European military
      dominance.

    explanation: The article states that low economic surplus, not high, was a limiting
      factor. The other options correctly identify barriers to the diffusion of military
      technology.
    options:
    - Slow and limited transportation
    - High economic surplus for military investment
    - Low overall technological development
    - Geographic and topographic barriers
    question_text: Which of the following was NOT a major factor limiting the diffusion
      of military technology in the remote past?
  index: 390
  key_concept: Diffusion and Development of Military Technology
  name: General considerations
- aspects:
  - content: A military ecosphere is a geographic region that develops its own distinct
      military technologies and systems, shaped by local geography, resources, and
      social structures. Boundaries can be physical (mountains, oceans) or defined
      by differences in terrain, vegetation, and man-made features.
    type: Definition
  - content: Examples of military ecospheres include Mesoamerica, Japan, India–Southeast
      Asia, China, and Europe. The Eurasian Steppe is noted for its indigenous military
      system based on horse archers. Some ecospheres, like Japan, developed coherent
      and effective systems with little external influence, while others, like Europe
      and China, had enduring impacts on global military technology.
    type: Examples
  - content: Regional variation in military technology meant that certain areas could
      resist or dominate others based on their unique adaptations. The eventual breakdown
      of regional isolation, especially after the 15th century, led to the absorption
      of local systems into the European military ecosphere.
    type: Implications
  - content: The concept of military ecospheres is linked to the study of cultural
      diffusion, technological innovation, and the impact of environment on societal
      development. It also helps explain why certain regions became centers of military
      innovation and dominance.
