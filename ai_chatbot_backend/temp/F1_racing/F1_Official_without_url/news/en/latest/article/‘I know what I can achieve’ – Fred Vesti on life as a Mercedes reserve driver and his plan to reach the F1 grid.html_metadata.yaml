      and engineering staff, primarily through extensive simulator work and occasional
      on-track participation. Their main responsibility is to help optimize car performance
      and prepare for races, often serving as a bridge between virtual testing and
      real-world application.
    type: Definition
  - content: Fred Vesti spends up to nine hours a day in the simulator at Mercedes'
      Brackley base, focusing on both current and future car development (notably
      for the 2026 car). He also participated in two Free Practice 1 sessions in 2025
      (Bahrain and Mexico), translating simulator insights into real-world feedback.
    type: Examples
  - content: Simulator work is used to prepare drivers like George Russell and Kimi
      Antonelli for unfamiliar tracks, such as the Las Vegas circuit. It allows for
      testing setup changes, learning new regulations, and providing immediate feedback
      to engineers, which is especially valuable for rookie drivers or when preparing
      for significant regulation changes.
    type: Use Cases
  - content: Being a reserve driver offers invaluable experience in both technical
      and team integration aspects, enabling young drivers to showcase their talent,
      adapt to F1 team operations, and build credibility with decision-makers. It
      also allows teams to test and validate simulator findings in real practice sessions.
