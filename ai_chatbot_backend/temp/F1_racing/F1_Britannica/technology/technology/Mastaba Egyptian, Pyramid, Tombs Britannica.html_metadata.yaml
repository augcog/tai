sections:
- aspects:
  - content: A mastaba is a type of rectangular superstructure that served as a tomb
      in ancient Egypt, typically constructed from mud brick or, in later periods,
      stone. It features sloping walls and a flat roof, with a deep vertical shaft
      leading down to the underground burial chamber. The term 'mastaba' derives from
      the Arabic word for 'bench,' reflecting its bench-like shape.
    type: Definition
  - content: The mastaba was first identified archaeologically in the 19th century
      during Auguste Mariette’s excavations at Ṣaqqārah. Initially, the term referred
      specifically to the flat-topped stone superstructures found there, but it was
      later applied to similar mud brick constructions. Mastabas were predominant
      during Egypt’s Old Kingdom, especially for nonroyal burials, and represent a
      significant stage in the evolution of Egyptian funerary architecture.
    type: Historical Context
  - content: Mastabas are characterized by their rectangular plan, sloping exterior
      walls, and flat roof. A vertical shaft descends from the superstructure to the
      burial chamber below ground. Over time, mastabas evolved from simple, architecturally
      undemanding forms to more complex structures featuring chapels, offering tables,
      and false doors for the deceased’s spirit. Storage chambers within the mastaba
      were stocked with food and equipment for the afterlife, and walls were often
      decorated with scenes depicting daily activities.
    type: Architectural Features
  - content: Mastabas played a crucial role in ancient Egyptian religious beliefs
      about the afterlife. The inclusion of chapels, offering tables, and false doors
      was intended to facilitate the continued existence and sustenance of the deceased’s
      spirit. The decorative scenes and storage of provisions reflect the expectation
      that the deceased would continue their daily life in the afterworld. Mastabas
      are closely linked to ancient Egyptian religion and the broader tradition of
      funerary architecture.
    type: Cultural and Religious Significance
  - content: The mastaba represents an early phase in Egyptian tomb construction,
      preceding the development of step pyramids and true pyramids. While initially
      simple, mastabas became increasingly elaborate, influencing later royal tombs
      and monumental architecture. The transition from mastaba to pyramid is exemplified
      by the Step Pyramid of Djoser at Ṣaqqārah, which began as a series of mastabas
      stacked atop one another. Thus, mastabas are foundational to understanding the
      progression of Egyptian architectural and religious practices.
