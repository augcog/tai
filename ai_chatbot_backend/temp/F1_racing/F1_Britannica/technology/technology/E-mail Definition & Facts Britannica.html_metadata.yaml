    and its technical process?
  question_type: recap
sections:
- aspects:
  - content: E-mail, or electronic mail, refers to messages transmitted and received
      by digital computers through a network. It is a form of telecommunication that
      enables users to send and receive information electronically, typically via
      the Internet or internal organizational networks. The term encompasses both
      the technology and the actual messages exchanged.
    type: definition
  - content: A defining feature of e-mail is the use of the 'at sign' (@) in addresses,
      which separates the user's name from the domain of the hosting server. This
      structure is now globally recognized and essential for routing messages correctly.
      The format supports both individual and group communication.
    type: symbolism and structure
  - content: E-mail has become one of the most widely used communication tools worldwide,
      revolutionizing personal, academic, and business correspondence. Its development
      is tied to the broader history of computer networking and the Internet, with
      key figures such as Vinton Cerf contributing to its evolution. E-mail's ubiquity
      has also led to the emergence of related concepts like spam, phishing, and business
      e-mail compromise.

- aspects:
  - content: An e-mail is a message that is transmitted and received by computers
      through a network. It can contain text and, depending on the system, may also
      include attachments such as images, documents, or multimedia files. E-mail serves
      as a digital alternative to traditional mail, providing rapid and asynchronous
      communication.
    type: definition and core function
  - content: Examples of e-mail usage include sending a business memo, sharing academic
      research, or communicating with friends. E-mails can be sent to one recipient
      or multiple recipients simultaneously, making them suitable for both personal
      and mass communication.
    type: examples and usage
  - content: Unlike phone calls or instant messaging, e-mail allows for more formal,
      documented, and often asynchronous exchanges. It is preferred for official communication
      due to its ability to store and archive messages for future reference.
