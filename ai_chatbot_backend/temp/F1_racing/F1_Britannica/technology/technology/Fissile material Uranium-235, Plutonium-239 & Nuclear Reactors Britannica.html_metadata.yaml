  explanation: Fissile materials can undergo fission with low-energy (thermal) neutrons
    and sustain a chain reaction, whereas fertile materials cannot but can be converted
    into fissile materials through neutron absorption.

- aspects:
  - content: Fissile material refers to any species of atomic nucleus that can undergo
      the fission reaction when struck by a neutron. In nuclear physics, this property
      is critical because it allows for the release of substantial amounts of energy,
      which is harnessed in nuclear reactors and weapons. Fissile materials can sustain
      a chain reaction, especially with low-energy (thermal) neutrons, distinguishing
      them from other nuclear materials.
    type: Definition
  - content: The principal fissile materials are uranium-235, plutonium-239, and uranium-233.
      Uranium-235 is naturally occurring but only makes up about 0.7% of natural uranium.
      Plutonium-239 and uranium-233 are not found in nature in significant quantities
      and are produced artificially from fertile materials. Each of these isotopes
      can sustain a nuclear chain reaction, making them suitable for use in nuclear
      reactors and weapons.
    type: Examples
  - content: Fissile materials are essential for the operation of both nuclear reactors
      and nuclear weapons. In reactors, they serve as the fuel that undergoes fission
      to release energy for electricity generation. In nuclear weapons, their ability
      to rapidly sustain a chain reaction is exploited for explosive yields. The selection
      of fissile material depends on factors such as availability, ease of enrichment
      or production, and reactor design.
    type: Use Cases
  - content: The presence and control of fissile materials have significant implications
      for energy policy, nonproliferation, and international security. Their production,
      handling, and storage are tightly regulated to prevent diversion for weapons
      use. The distinction between fissile and fertile materials also underpins the
      design of breeder reactors, which aim to convert fertile into fissile materials
      for more efficient fuel use.
    type: Implications and Context
  - content: Fissile materials are closely related to fertile materials, which cannot
      undergo fission with low-energy neutrons but can be converted into fissile isotopes
      through neutron absorption and subsequent decay. Understanding the interplay
      between fissile and fertile materials is fundamental to nuclear fuel cycles,
      reactor design, and strategies for managing nuclear waste and proliferation
      risks.

    explanation: Fissile material is defined as a material whose atomic nuclei can
      undergo fission upon absorbing a neutron, and it can sustain a chain reaction,
      especially with low-energy (thermal) neutrons. Option 2 describes fertile material,
      option 3 is too vague, and option 4 is incorrect because fissile materials can
      react with low-energy neutrons.
    options:
    - A material that can undergo fission after absorbing a neutron, sustaining a
      chain reaction.
    - A material that cannot undergo fission with low-energy neutrons but can be converted
      into a fissile isotope.
    - A material that is naturally radioactive but does not participate in chain reactions.
    - A material that only undergoes fission with high-energy neutrons and cannot
      sustain a chain reaction.
