sections:
- aspects:
  - content: Photographic film is a material coated with light-sensitive compounds,
      typically silver halide crystals suspended in a gelatin emulsion. When exposed
      to light, these crystals undergo a chemical change that forms a latent image,
      which can later be developed into a visible photograph. The film's emulsion
      is crucial for capturing and storing the image information until processing.
    type: Definition
  - content: Common types of photographic film include black-and-white film, which
      uses silver bromide and sometimes silver iodide, and color film, which contains
      multiple layers sensitive to different wavelengths. Specialized films, such
      as radiographic film for X-ray imaging, have higher concentrations of silver
      halide to increase sensitivity.
    type: Examples
  - content: Photographic film is used in still photography, motion pictures, medical
      imaging (radiography), and scientific applications like spectroscopy. Its ability
      to record and preserve light patterns makes it foundational to visual documentation
      and analysis.
    type: Use Cases
  - content: The chemical nature of film determines its sensitivity, contrast, and
      resolution. Innovations in emulsion chemistry have led to films with higher
      speed, finer grain, and greater dynamic range, impacting artistic and scientific
      practices.
    type: Implications
  - content: Film technology is closely related to the development of cameras, printing
      processes (like halftone for publications), and the evolution of digital imaging,
      which has largely supplanted film in many areas but still relies on principles
      established by film chemistry.

      glass or paper) base coated with a gelatin emulsion containing light-sensitive
      silver halide crystals. This distinguishes it from other imaging supports like
      glass plates or digital sensors.
    options:
    - A plastic base coated with silver halide crystals in gelatin
    - A glass plate with iron oxide coating
    - A paper sheet coated with cellulose acetate

- aspects:
  - content: The historical development of film refers to the progression from early
      photographic supports, such as glass plates and paper, to flexible, transparent
      plastic-based films. This transition enabled new forms of photography and cinematography.
    type: Definition
  - content: Eastman’s 'American film' was initially paper-based, with the image-carrying
      gelatin layer transferred to a transparent support after processing. In 1889,
      this was replaced by nitrocellulose-based transparent film, which became standard
      for both still and motion picture photography.
    type: Examples
  - content: The invention of roll film allowed for portable cameras, mass-market
      photography, and the birth of the motion picture industry. The flexibility and
      durability of plastic film made rapid sequential exposures and long reels possible.
    type: Use Cases
  - content: The shift to plastic film revolutionized image capture, making photography
      and filmmaking more accessible and practical. It also introduced issues such
      as flammability (with nitrocellulose) and long-term stability, leading to further
      innovations like safety film.
    type: Implications
  - content: Advances in film paralleled developments in camera technology, printing,
      and media distribution. The move from glass to flexible film was a key enabler
      of modern visual culture, influencing everything from amateur snapshots to Hollywood
      cinema.

- aspects:
  - content: Film formats refer to the physical dimensions and characteristics of
      photographic and motion picture film, such as width (gauge), length, and perforation
      patterns. These formats determine compatibility with cameras, projectors, and
      other equipment.
    type: Definition
  - content: Common film gauges include 8mm, 16mm, 35mm, and 70mm, each serving different
      purposes. For example, 35mm is standard for theatrical motion pictures, while
      65mm/70mm is used for high-resolution special effects and IMAX. Specialized
      formats exist for scientific and industrial uses.
    type: Examples
  - content: Film formats are chosen based on the desired image quality, application,
      and equipment. Smaller formats are used for home movies and amateur photography;
      larger formats for professional cinema and high-fidelity imaging.
    type: Use Cases
  - content: The choice of format affects image resolution, cost, and portability.
      Technological advances have allowed for greater image quality at smaller sizes,
      but larger formats remain important for specific high-quality or archival needs.
    type: Implications
  - content: Film formats are linked to the evolution of camera and projector technology,
      as well as to the standardization of media production and distribution. The
      persistence of certain gauges (like 35mm) has shaped the aesthetics and economics
      of visual media.

- aspects:
  - content: Photographic film is used as a passive detector in radiation measurement
      and medical imaging, such as X-ray radiography. These films are designed to
      be sensitive to various types of radiation, not just visible light.
    type: Definition
  - content: Radiographic films for X-ray imaging have a higher concentration of silver
      halide crystals to respond to low doses of X-rays. Film badge dosimeters use
      photographic film to monitor occupational exposure to ionizing radiation, while
      specialized films record gamma-ray or neutron exposures in scientific research.
    type: Examples
  - content: Medical radiography uses film to produce diagnostic images of the body's
      interior. In occupational health, film badges monitor cumulative radiation exposure
      for workers. Scientific applications include detecting and measuring radiation
      in laboratory experiments.
    type: Use Cases
  - content: Film’s sensitivity to radiation has made it indispensable for non-invasive
      diagnostics and safety monitoring. The ability to store a permanent record of
      exposure or diagnostic images is a major advantage, though digital detectors
      are now replacing film in many contexts.
    type: Implications
  - content: The use of film in radiation detection connects photography to physics
      and medicine, illustrating the versatility of photographic technology. Innovations
      in film chemistry for these applications have influenced the development of
      faster, more sensitive photographic materials.
    type: Connections

- aspects:
  - content: Celluloid and nitrocellulose are early forms of plastic used as the base
      for photographic film. Celluloid is a clear, flexible material derived from
      nitrocellulose and camphor, while nitrocellulose itself is a chemically modified
      cellulose.
    type: Definition
  - content: Celluloid film, processed by researchers like Henry Reichenbach at Eastman
      Kodak, became the standard for photographic and motion picture film despite
      its flammability and tendency to degrade. Nitrocellulose was used in collodion
      solutions for wet plate photography and as a base for early flexible films.
    type: Examples
  - content: Celluloid and nitrocellulose films were used in still photography, motion
      pictures, and medical imaging. Their flexibility and transparency enabled the
      mass adoption of roll film and portable cameras.
    type: Use Cases
  - content: 'While revolutionary, both materials posed risks: nitrocellulose is highly
      flammable, leading to fires in theaters and archives, and both degrade over
      time, threatening the preservation of historical films. These issues prompted
      the development of safer alternatives like cellulose acetate (''safety film'').'
    type: Implications
  - content: The use of celluloid and nitrocellulose links the history of photography
      to the broader history of plastics and materials science. Their adoption marked
      a turning point in mass media and industrial chemistry, influencing the design
      of countless consumer products.
