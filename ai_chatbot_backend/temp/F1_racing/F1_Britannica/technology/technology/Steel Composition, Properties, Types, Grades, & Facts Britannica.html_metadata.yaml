sections:
- aspects:
  - content: Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon, with the carbon content typically
      ranging up to 2 percent. If the carbon content exceeds this limit, the material
      is classified as cast iron rather than steel. Steel is distinguished from pure
      iron by its enhanced mechanical properties, which are largely attributable to
      the presence of carbon and, in some cases, other alloying elements.
    type: definition
  - content: Steel is the most widely used engineering material globally, employed
      in the construction of infrastructure such as buildings, bridges, and oil tankers,
      as well as in the manufacture of everyday items like sewing needles. The tools
      necessary for fabricating and manufacturing these products are also often made
      from steel, demonstrating its versatility and importance across diverse industries.
    type: examples and applications
  - content: The popularity of steel is due to its relatively low production cost,
      the abundance of its raw materials (iron ore and scrap), and its wide range
      of mechanical properties. In 2013, global raw steel production reached about
      1.6 billion tons, vastly outpacing the next most important engineering metal,
      aluminum, which had a production volume of approximately 47 million tons. This
      underscores steel's foundational role in modern economies and technological
      advancement.
    type: economic and industrial significance
  - content: Steel is closely related to other iron-based materials such as cast iron
      and wrought iron, but its unique combination of strength, ductility, and workability
      sets it apart. Alloying elements such as chromium, nickel, and manganese can
      further modify its properties, leading to specialized steels like stainless
      steel and tool steel.

    explanation: Steel is defined as an alloy of iron and carbon, with the carbon
      content typically not exceeding 2%. Pure iron lacks the mechanical properties
      of steel, and aluminum alloys are distinct materials.
    options:
    - A pure metal consisting only of iron.
    - An alloy of iron and carbon with up to 2% carbon content.
    - A non-metallic compound used in construction.
    - A form of aluminum alloyed with iron.
    question_text: Which of the following statements best describes steel?
  index: 283
  key_concept: steel
  name: steel
- aspects:
  - content: Iron, the primary component of steel, is a polycrystalline metal that
      exists in different crystalline forms (allotropes) depending on temperature.
      At lower temperatures (below 912°C), iron adopts a body-centred cubic (bcc)
      structure known as alpha iron or ferrite, which is stable up to 912°C and again
      from 1394°C to its melting point as delta iron. Between 912°C and 1394°C, iron
      transitions to a face-centred cubic (fcc) structure called gamma iron or austenite.
      The fcc structure provides more space for foreign atoms, which is significant
      for alloying.
    type: crystal structure and allotropy
  - content: Iron exhibits strong ferromagnetic properties below 770°C, a temperature
      known as the Curie point. Above this temperature, iron loses its magnetism,
      a phenomenon important in both materials science and industrial applications.
    type: magnetic properties
  - content: Pure iron is relatively soft and not suitable for most engineering applications.
      Its mechanical properties are significantly enhanced when alloyed with carbon
      and other elements, forming steel. The ability of iron to exist in different
      crystalline forms allows for various heat treatments and alloying strategies
      that tailor the properties of steel for specific uses.
    type: mechanical properties and implications
  - content: The allotropic transformations of iron are retained in steel, even when
      alloyed with significant amounts of other elements. This behavior underlies
      many of the thermal and mechanical treatments applied to steel, influencing
      its microstructure and, consequently, its mechanical properties.
    type: connections to steel behavior
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 2
    explanation: Iron exhibits body-centred cubic (bcc) structure (ferrite/alpha or
      delta iron) at lower and higher temperatures, and face-centred cubic (fcc) structure
      (austenite/gamma iron) at intermediate temperatures. Its magnetic properties
      change at the Curie point.
    options:
    - Iron remains in a single crystal structure regardless of temperature.
    - Iron is always ferromagnetic, even at high temperatures.
    - Iron exhibits both bcc and fcc structures at different temperature ranges.
    - Iron's fcc structure is called ferrite.
    question_text: Which statement about iron's crystal structure is correct?
  index: 414
  key_concept: 'The base metal: iron'
  name: 'The base metal: [iron](https://www.britannica.com/science/iron-chemical-element
    "https://www.britannica.com/science/iron-chemical-element")'
- aspects:
  - content: Carbon is the principal element used to strengthen iron and convert it
      into steel. In its pure form, iron is too soft for most engineering purposes.
      The addition of small amounts of carbon increases the hardness and strength
      of the alloy, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
    type: role in steel strengthening
  - content: In steel, carbon is found either dissolved in solid solution within the
      iron matrix (in ferrite or austenite) or as carbides, such as iron carbide (Fe3C,
      known as cementite) or carbides of other alloying elements like titanium. The
      presence of silicon can alter this by promoting the formation of graphite in
      cast irons rather than carbides.
    type: forms of carbon in steel
  - content: The iron-carbon equilibrium diagram illustrates how carbon content affects
      the solidification and microstructure of steel. As steel cools, austenite (fcc)
      transforms into a mixture of ferrite (bcc) and cementite, forming structures
      like pearlite. The eutectoid transformation at 727°C produces pearlite, a fine
      lamellar structure with alternating layers of ferrite and cementite, which significantly
      increases hardness compared to pure iron.
    type: microstructural changes and phase transformations
  - content: The hardness and mechanical properties of steel are directly influenced
      by its carbon content and resulting microstructure. For example, steel with
      0.77% carbon forms entirely pearlite and has a diamond pyramid hardness (DPH)
      of about 200 kgf/mm², while lower carbon steels have mixed microstructures (ferrite
      and pearlite) and are softer. Higher carbon steels (>0.77%) contain pearlite
      and cementite, resulting in even greater hardness.
    type: mechanical properties and hardness
  - content: Increasing carbon content lowers the solidification temperature of steel,
      which is why cast irons (with >2% carbon) are processed at lower temperatures
      than steels. The specific microstructures formed during cooling—such as pearlite,
      ferrite, and cementite—determine the steel's suitability for various industrial
      applications, from ductile low-carbon steels for construction to hard, wear-resistant
      high-carbon steels for cutting tools.
    type: practical implications and edge cases
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: Carbon strengthens steel by forming solid solutions and carbides,
      and it lowers the solidification temperature. Higher carbon content generally
      increases hardness and strength, while also affecting the microstructure (e.g.,
      formation of pearlite and cementite).
    options:
    - It makes steel softer and more ductile as its content increases.
    - It increases steel's hardness and strength by forming carbides and influencing
      microstructure.
    - It has no effect on the solidification temperature of steel.
    - It causes steel to lose its metallic properties.
