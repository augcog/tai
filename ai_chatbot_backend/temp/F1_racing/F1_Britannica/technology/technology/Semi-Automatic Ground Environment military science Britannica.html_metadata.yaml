- aspects:
  - content: The Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) was an advanced air defense
      system developed during the Cold War to detect, track, and intercept enemy aircraft,
      particularly bombers. Its primary purpose was to integrate radar data, process
      it using computers, and coordinate military responses to aerial threats in real
      time. SAGE represented a significant leap in military command and control systems,
      emphasizing automation and rapid data analysis.
    type: Definition and Purpose
  - content: SAGE was notable for being one of the first large-scale uses of computers
      in military applications. It utilized massive mainframe computers, CRT (cathode-ray
      tube) displays, and innovative input devices like light pens. The system included
      23 direction centers, each capable of tracking up to 400 aircraft simultaneously,
      distinguishing between friendly and enemy planes. These features made SAGE a
      technological marvel of its era.
    type: Technological Features
  - content: Operational by 1957, SAGE marked a turning point in both military defense
      and the evolution of computer technology. It was the first U.S. air defense
      system to achieve such integration and automation, influencing subsequent developments
      in both military and civilian computing. Its scale and complexity set new standards
      for real-time data processing and networked command systems.
