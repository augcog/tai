      of the entire Sauber Group, making Audi the sole owner of the Swiss-based Formula
      1 team. This move marks a transition from Audi’s initial plan to be a power
      unit supplier and partial stakeholder to full team ownership, solidifying their
      commitment to F1 ahead of the 2026 season.
    type: Definition
  - content: The takeover comes in anticipation of major regulatory changes in Formula
      1 in 2026, which include new power unit rules emphasizing increased electrical

      operational approaches without compromise, accelerating development and decision-making.

      a strong contender in the new regulatory era.
    type: Implications
  - content: Other automotive giants, such as Mercedes-Benz and Ferrari, have historically

      involvement in F1 as the sport emphasizes sustainability and hybrid technology.
