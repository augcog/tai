id:Sawyer (Level1) > (h1) MoveIt Tutorials > (h2) Getting Started with MoveIt and RViz
question:How can I rapidly become proficient in using the MoveIt Motion Planning Framework, specifically for the Franka Emika Panda robot, through the provided tutorials, and are there alternative robots that are already compatible with MoveIt? Please list them and provide me with a resource for further exploration. Additionally, if my custom robot is not yet supported by MoveIt, how can I integrate it into the framework using the tutorial section "Integration with a New Robot"? Provide me with a step-by-step guide and necessary resources.
id:Sawyer (Level1) > (h1) MoveIt Tutorials > (h2) MoveGroup - ROS Wrappers in C++ and Python
question:How can I utilize the MoveGroup interface, available in both C++ and Python, to efficiently interact with MoveIt and access its various features through scripting, as described in the "MoveGroup - ROS Wrappers in C++ and Python" section of this document? Please provide a step-by-step guide, including any necessary prerequisites and examples of how to use the interface to manipulate the robot's movements and configurations. Additionally, clarify any potential limitations or trade-offs of relying solely on the MoveGroup interface, and offer alternatives or complementary approaches for more advanced MoveIt applications.
id:Sawyer (Level1) > (h1) MoveIt Tutorials > (h2) Using MoveIt Directly Through the C++ API
question:How can developers utilize MoveIt's C++ API to build more complex applications with significantly faster performance, and what are the potential benefits of bypassing the ROS Service/Action layers in this process? Please provide specific examples and use cases to illustrate the advantages of directly accessing MoveIt's C++ API.
