      innovation and shifts in market dominance.
    type: Definition
  - content: Netscape Navigator quickly became dominant after its 1994 release, but
      was supplanted by Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, which was bundled with Windows
      and became the leading browser by the late 1990s. Later, Mozilla Firefox (2004)
      and Google Chrome (2008) emerged as major competitors, each introducing features
      that addressed speed, security, and stability.
    type: Historical Examples
  - content: Competition among browsers has driven technological advancements, improved
      security, and enhanced user experience. It has also led to legal and regulatory
      scrutiny, particularly regarding bundling practices and market monopolies.
