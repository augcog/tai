sections:
- aspects:
  - content: ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was the first large-scale,
      all-electronic digital computer, constructed at the Moore School of Electrical
      Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, in the mid-1940s. It marked a transition
      from electromechanical to electronic computation and is considered a first-generation
      computer.
    type: Definition
  - content: ENIAC used over 18,000 vacuum tubes, 70,000 resistors, and 1,500 relays,
      occupying a large physical space and consuming significant power. It was programmed
      via plugboards, which allowed for electronic speed but made reprogramming laborious
      and slow, taking days to rewire for new tasks. Its design was not fully general-purpose,
      being originally intended for artillery calculations.
    type: Technical Features and Limitations
  - content: Funded by the U.S. Army during World War II, ENIAC was completed after
      the war and was first used for hydrogen bomb calculations. It was the most powerful
      calculator of its time, capable of 5,000 additions per second, vastly outperforming
      previous machines. ENIAC's architecture and use of vacuum tubes set the stage
      for subsequent developments in electronic computing.
    type: Historical Context and Impact
  - content: ENIAC introduced conditional branching, allowing the machine to alter
      instruction flow based on data values, thus increasing its flexibility. Despite
      its limitations in programmability, it bridged the gap between special-purpose
      and more general-purpose machines. ENIAC is often cited as a milestone in computer
      history, influencing the design of future computers and the evolution of computer
      science.
    type: Innovations and Legacy
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: ENIAC required manual rewiring via plugboards to change programs,
      making reprogramming slow and cumbersome. It was electronic (not purely mechanical),
      could perform arithmetic, and was much larger and more powerful than its predecessors.
    options:
    - It could not perform any arithmetic operations.
    - It required manual rewiring to change programs.
    - It used only mechanical parts.
    - It was smaller and less powerful than previous machines.
    question_text: Which of the following best describes a major limitation of ENIAC
      compared to later computers?
  index: 292
  key_concept: ENIAC and First-Generation Electronic Computers
  name: '[ENIAC](https://www.britannica.com/technology/ENIAC "https://www.britannica.com/technology/ENIAC")'
- aspects:
  - content: After World War II, computer development shifted from special-purpose
      machines to the pursuit of general-purpose computing devices. This transition
      was motivated by the desire to create machines capable of solving a wide range
      of problems, not just those for which they were originally designed.
    type: Definition and Motivation
  - content: A key innovation was the use of mercury delay lines for memory storage,
      which allowed more bits to be stored with fewer vacuum tubes compared to ENIAC's
      one-tube-per-bit approach. This improved storage capacity and reliability, laying
      the groundwork for more complex and capable computers like EDVAC.
    type: Technical Innovations
  - content: The drive for general-purpose computing was influenced by the limitations
      of wartime computers, which were fast but constrained in function. The planning
      for EDVAC, ENIAC’s successor, began even before ENIAC was completed, reflecting
      the rapid pace of technological ambition and the recognition of storage as a
      bottleneck.
    type: Historical Context
  - content: The move to general-purpose designs and improved storage technologies
      enabled the creation of more versatile and powerful computers. The development
      of delay-line memory and, later, magnetic core memory, facilitated the transition
      to computers that could be reprogrammed efficiently and handle more complex
      tasks, influencing the entire trajectory of computer architecture.

      ENIAC?
  index: 438
  key_concept: Transition to General-Purpose and Enhanced Storage
  name: Bigger brains
- aspects:
  - content: The von Neumann architecture, articulated in the 1946 'Preliminary Discussion'
      paper, established the principle that data and instructions should be stored
      in the same memory. Instructions could be modified by other instructions, enabling
      programs to treat other programs as data.
    type: Definition and Principles
  - content: This architecture synthesized contemporary ideas and is widely regarded
      as the foundation of modern computer science. It enabled the development of
      high-level programming languages and more sophisticated software, as programs
      could be easily stored, modified, and executed.
    type: Historical Context and Influence
  - content: Storing instructions in electronic memory allowed for rapid access and
      made programming much more efficient compared to earlier methods like plugboards
      or mechanical card readers. This also meant that future computers would require
      much more memory than ENIAC.
    type: Practical Implications
  - content: The von Neumann model became the template for most subsequent computers,
      known as 'von Neumann machines.' Its influence persists in modern computer design,
      particularly in the way memory and instruction processing are organized.
    type: Connections and Legacy
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 2
    explanation: A key feature of the von Neumann architecture is that both data and
      instructions are stored in the same memory and instructions can be modified
      by other instructions, enabling more flexible and powerful programming.
    options:
    - Instructions and data are stored separately in different physical devices.
    - Programs are input only via punch cards.
    - Instructions and data are stored together in the same memory and can be modified
      by other instructions.
    - The computer uses only mechanical switches.
    question_text: What is a defining feature of the von Neumann architecture?
  index: 450
  key_concept: Von Neumann Architecture and the Stored-Program Concept
  name: Von Neumann’s “Preliminary Discussion”
- aspects:
  - content: Stored-program computers are those in which both the program instructions
      and data are held in the same memory, allowing the computer to execute instructions
      sequentially and modify them as needed. Early examples include the Manchester
      Baby, Manchester Mark I, and EDSAC.
    type: Definition and Examples
  - content: The Manchester Baby introduced direct-access storage using cathode-ray
      tubes, which was faster than mercury delay lines but less reliable. The Manchester
      Mark I added a two-level storage hierarchy and instruction modification registers,
      which evolved into index registers, greatly improving programming flexibility
      and efficiency.
    type: Technical Innovations
  - content: The British built the first operational stored-program computer (Manchester
      Baby) in 1948, followed by the Manchester Mark I and the Ferranti Mark I, the
      first commercial computer. EDSAC at Cambridge was the first to provide a formal
      computing service for users, emphasizing the growing importance of software
      and programming.
    type: Historical Milestones
  - content: The innovations in storage and instruction modification enabled more
      complex programming, such as array processing and dynamic memory addressing.
      These developments laid the foundation for modern computing practices, including
      the use of index registers and secondary storage devices like magnetic drums.
