- aspects:
  - content: A bus is a large, self-propelled, wheeled vehicle designed to carry passengers,
      typically on a fixed route. Modern buses are defined as vehicles that accommodate
      more than 10 passengers, offering a flexible alternative to streetcars. The
      term 'bus' is also synonymous with 'omnibus,' reflecting its function as a vehicle
      for all.
    type: Definition
  - content: The bus evolved from the horse-driven coach, with its development at
      the start of the 20th century aimed at competing with streetcars by offering
      greater route flexibility. This historical context highlights the bus as a response
      to urban mobility needs and technological advancements in transportation.
    type: Historical Context
  - content: Buses play a critical role in public transportation systems, providing
      commuter routes and mobility solutions in urban and suburban environments. Their
      development is closely linked to broader trends in urbanization, technological
      innovation, and the need for mass transit solutions.

  key_concept: Definition and Origins of the Bus
  name: bus
- aspects:
  - content: Early milestones include Sir Goldworthy Gurney's steam-powered stagecoach
      in 1830, the 1895 German eight-passenger omnibus, and Mack Trucks' 1900 sightseeing
      bus. The transition from truck-based to purpose-built bus chassis began in 1921
      with the Fageol Safety Coach, and the first integral-frame bus was introduced
      in 1926.
    type: Historical Milestones
  - content: Key innovations include the integral-frame design, which uses the roof,
      floor, and sides as structural members, and the introduction of gasoline-electric
      and diesel engines. Air suspension systems, introduced in 1953, improved ride
      quality and load management, while rear-engine and two-stroke diesel engines
      enhanced performance and efficiency.
    type: Engineering Innovations
  - content: Examples of technological evolution include Mack and Yellow Truck & Coach's
      gasoline-electric buses, the widespread adoption of diesel engines in 1938,
      and the continued use of air suspensions. These advancements reflect ongoing
      efforts to improve passenger comfort, vehicle durability, and operational efficiency.

  key_concept: Technological Development of Buses
  name: Development
- aspects:
  - content: 'Modern buses are classified into four main types: city (transit), suburban,
      intercity (tour), and school buses. Each type is designed with specific operational
      contexts and passenger needs in mind, influencing their features and configurations.'
    type: Classification
  - content: City buses are characterized by low platforms, provision for standing
      and wheelchair passengers, multiple entrances, and minimal luggage space. Suburban
      buses have high-back seats and luggage compartments, while intercity coaches
      offer high-ride platforms, restrooms, overhead racks, and amenities like reading
      lights. School buses are built for safety, with special signal lamps and truck
      chassis.
    type: Key Features and Examples
  - content: The design of modern buses reflects trends such as increased urbanization,
      demand for accessibility, and the need for efficient mass transit. Articulated
      and double-decker buses have been introduced to increase capacity and fuel efficiency,
      while hybrid-electric models and intermodal systems are being developed to address
      environmental concerns.
    type: Implications and Trends
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:

  key_concept: Types and Features of Modern Buses
  name: Modern buses
- aspects:
  - content: In the United States, new exhaust emission standards for buses were implemented
      in 2006 and 2007, mandating a 95% reduction in smog-related emissions and a
      90% reduction in soot compared to 2000 levels. These regulations required the
      adoption of reformulated diesel fuels with sulfur content capped at 15 parts
      per million.
    type: Regulatory Changes
  - content: The stricter emission standards have driven technological innovation
      in bus engines and fuel systems, leading to the development of cleaner diesel
      engines and the exploration of hybrid-electric and alternative-fuel buses. These
      changes aim to reduce the environmental impact of public transportation.
    type: Implications for Technology
  - content: Environmental regulations for buses are part of a global trend toward
      reducing pollution from urban transportation. These efforts are connected to
      broader initiatives in sustainable mobility, intermodal transit systems, and
      urban planning aimed at improving air quality and public health.
    type: Connections to Broader Trends
