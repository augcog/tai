sections:
- aspects:
  - content: The chassis is the structural framework of an automobile, serving as
      the skeleton to which the engine, wheels, axles, transmission, steering, brakes,
      and suspension are attached. Traditionally, this was a pressed-steel frame in
      a body-on-frame construction, where the body was flexibly bolted to the chassis.
      In modern cars, the chassis and body are often integrated into a single unit,
      known as unit-body or unibody construction.
    type: Definition
  - content: Body-on-frame construction remains common in heavy-duty vehicles like
      trucks due to its strength and ability to absorb engine and axle movements.
      In contrast, most passenger cars now use unibody construction, which incorporates
      a reinforced steel shell for rigidity and safety. Some vehicles use partial
      or 'stub' frames to improve noise isolation. The use of heavier-gauge steel
      in modern chassis helps absorb impact energy and limit intrusion during accidents.
    type: Examples and Evolution
  - content: The shift from body-on-frame to unibody construction has significant
      implications for vehicle safety, noise reduction, and manufacturing efficiency.
      Unibody designs allow for lighter, more rigid vehicles with better crash performance,
      while body-on-frame remains preferable for vehicles subjected to heavy loads.
      The chassis design also affects the integration of other systems, such as suspension
      and drivetrain components.
    type: Implications and Connections
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 2
    explanation: Body-on-frame construction uses a separate frame with the body flexibly
      bolted on, which is common in trucks. Unibody (unit-body) construction combines
      the body and chassis into a single, reinforced structure, which is the norm
      for modern passenger cars. Unibody designs are generally more rigid and offer
      better crash protection.
    options:
    - Body-on-frame construction integrates the body and chassis into a single structure.
    - Unibody construction is primarily used in heavy-duty trucks for strength.
    - Body-on-frame construction features a separate chassis and body, while unibody
      combines them into one structure.
    - Unibody construction is less rigid than body-on-frame and offers poorer crash
      protection.

  name: '[Chassis](https://www.britannica.com/technology/chassis-mechanics "https://www.britannica.com/technology/chassis-mechanics")'
- aspects:
  - content: Automobile engines are primarily internal-combustion engines, with the
      reciprocating-piston gasoline engine operating on a four-stroke cycle being
      the most common. Diesel engines are widely used for trucks and buses. Other
      types, such as battery-powered electric motors and hybrid systems, have been
      developed to address environmental concerns and fuel efficiency.
    type: Definition and Types
  - content: In the United States, the trend moved from long, straight engine layouts
      to compact V-type six- and eight-cylinder engines for larger cars, while smaller
      cars use four-cylinder engines. European cars have displayed greater diversity,
      with engines ranging from 1 to 12 cylinders, and both in-line and V-type arrangements.
      Air-cooled, rear-mounted engines were also common in some European models.
    type: Historical and Regional Variations
  - content: Advancements include the use of overhead camshafts, variable valve timing,
      and electronic controls to optimize performance and emissions. Hybrid systems
      that combine internal combustion engines with electric motors have emerged to
      reduce greenhouse gas emissions, though they introduce complexity and cost.
      The evolution of engine design is closely linked to regulatory, economic, and
      environmental pressures.
    type: Technological Developments and Implications
  - content: Examples include the four-stroke gasoline engine, four-stroke diesel
      engine, and V-type engine layouts. Smaller engines with higher compression ratios
      and more valves per cylinder have been developed to improve efficiency and reduce
      emissions. Electronic controls now allow engines to switch between different
      cam profiles for optimal performance under varying conditions.

      with electric motors to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. Diesel
      engines are common in trucks and buses but not in most passenger cars. V-type
      engines are used globally, and overhead camshafts are a common feature in modern
      engine design.
    options:
    - Diesel engines are the most common in passenger cars worldwide.
    - Hybrid power systems combine internal combustion engines with electric motors
      to reduce emissions.
    - V-type engines are only used in European cars.
    - Overhead camshafts are outdated and rarely used in modern engines.
    question_text: Which of the following statements about modern automobile engines
      is accurate?
  index: 325
  key_concept: Engine types and evolution
  name: Engine
- aspects:
  - content: Automobile fuels primarily include specially formulated gasoline and,
      for many trucks and buses, diesel fuel. Experimental fuels such as compressed
      liquefied hydrogen and natural gas have also been used. The choice of fuel affects
      engine performance, emissions, and operational range.
    type: Definition and Types
  - content: Important fuel characteristics include volatility (which affects cold
      starting), antiknock quality (measured by octane number), and cleanliness (freedom
      from polluting by-products). The required octane number depends on engine compression
      ratio, combustion-chamber design, and maintenance. Regular gasoline typically
      has an octane rating of 87, while premium grades are around 93.
    type: Key Requirements and Ratings
  - content: Regulations have increasingly required cleaner-burning fuels to enable
      emission-control devices to function efficiently. For example, sulfur content
      in gasoline has been reduced to 10 ppm in the United States since 2017. Cleaner
      fuels help reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
    type: Environmental and Regulatory Context
  - content: Natural gas and ethanol are alternative fuels with specific advantages
      and trade-offs. Natural gas reduces carbon monoxide and particulates but requires
      larger tanks, reducing cargo space. Ethanol is often blended with gasoline to
      raise octane ratings but has lower energy density, reducing vehicle range. These
      alternatives are part of broader efforts to reduce the environmental impact
      of transportation.
    type: Alternative Fuels and Implications
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: Ethanol is blended with gasoline to raise its octane rating, which
      helps prevent engine knocking and results in smoother operation. However, ethanol
      has a lower energy density than gasoline, so it does not increase energy content
      per volume.
    options:
    - To increase the fuel's volatility for cold starts
    - To raise the octane rating and achieve smoother engine operation
    - To reduce the size of the fuel tank needed
    - To increase the energy density of the fuel
    question_text: What is a primary reason for blending ethanol with gasoline in
      automobile fuels?

  key_concept: Fuel requirements and alternatives
  name: '[Fuel](https://www.britannica.com/technology/fuel "https://www.britannica.com/technology/fuel")'
- aspects:
  - content: Lubrication in automobiles involves applying oil or grease to moving
      parts to reduce friction, minimize wear, and prevent damage. The lubricant also
      serves as a coolant, noise-reducing cushion, and sealant between engine piston
      rings and cylinder walls. Proper lubrication is essential for efficient and
      long-lasting vehicle operation.
    type: Definition and Function
  - content: 'The engine lubrication system typically uses a gear-type pump to deliver
      filtered oil under pressure through drilled passages to various bearings. Oil
      spray lubricates cams and valve lifters. Different parts of the vehicle require
      different lubricants: wheel bearings and universal joints use stiff grease,
      while chassis joints use softer grease. Hydraulic transmissions use light hydraulic
      fluid, and manual transmissions use heavier gear oil.'
    type: System Components and Operation
  - content: Lightly loaded components, such as generators and window regulators,
      may use self-lubricating plastic materials. Hydraulic fluid is also used in
      conjunction with electric pumps and motors in various vehicle systems. Advances
      in lubricant formulations and materials have improved reliability and reduced
      maintenance requirements.
    type: Materials and Innovations
  - content: Effective lubrication is critical for reducing power consumption, extending
      the lifespan of components, and ensuring smooth and quiet operation. Poor lubrication
      can lead to increased friction, overheating, and catastrophic engine or transmission
      failure. The choice of lubricant must match the specific load and temperature
      requirements of each component.
