sections:
- aspects:
  - content: The term 'talud' refers to the sloping batter or inclined plane that
      forms part of a stepped pyramid or platform in Mesoamerican architecture. It
      is a structural and visual element that supports or underlies other architectural
      features, most notably the tablero (a rectangular panel). The talud is essential
      for the stability and distinctive appearance of many ancient Mesoamerican monuments.
    type: Definition
  - content: Talud is most famously seen in the architecture of Teotihuacán, where
      it forms the lower portion of each tier in stepped pyramids. The talud is paired
      with the tablero to create the iconic talud-tablero motif. This motif is a hallmark
      of Teotihuacán and can be observed in structures such as the Pyramid of the
      Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon. The use of the talud is not limited to Teotihuacán;
      it influenced later Mesoamerican cultures, including the Maya and the Toltecs.
    type: Examples and Context
  - content: The talud's sloped design provides structural stability to large stone
      constructions, allowing for the creation of monumental architecture that could
      withstand environmental and seismic pressures. The visual rhythm created by
      alternating taluds and tableros also had symbolic and aesthetic significance,
      possibly reflecting cosmological beliefs or social hierarchies. The motif's
      spread across Mesoamerica indicates cultural exchange and the influence of Teotihuacán's
      architectural innovations.

    explanation: The talud is the sloping support or batter that underlies other architectural
      elements, most notably the tablero. It is not primarily decorative, ceremonial,
      or a drainage feature.
    options:
    - It serves as a decorative panel.
    - It acts as a sloping support for upper elements.
    - It is used as a ceremonial platform.
    - It functions as a drainage system.

- aspects:
  - content: The talud-tablero motif is an architectural style characterized by the
      alternation of a sloping talud (batter) and a vertical or rectangular tablero
      (panel) on the tiers of stepped pyramids and platforms. This motif became a
      defining element of Teotihuacán architecture and is recognized by its distinctive
      profile and repetitive pattern.
    type: Definition
  - content: This motif is most prominently featured in the pyramids and platforms
      of Teotihuacán, such as the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon.
      Each level of these structures displays a talud supporting a tablero, often
      framed and sometimes decorated with murals or reliefs. The motif was adopted
      and adapted by other Mesoamerican cultures, including the Maya at sites like
      Tikal and the Toltecs at Tula, demonstrating its wide influence.
    type: Examples and Use Cases
  - content: The talud-tablero motif served both structural and symbolic purposes.
      Structurally, it allowed for stable and visually impressive stepped pyramids.
      Symbolically, the repetitive pattern may have represented cosmological ideas
      or social order, and its adoption by various cultures suggests it was associated
      with power, prestige, or religious significance. The motif also facilitated
      the addition of decorative and narrative elements on the tablero panels, integrating
      art with architecture.

    explanation: The talud-tablero motif consists of a rectangular (tablero) panel
      above a sloping (talud) batter. It is not characterized by arches, flat roofs,
      or rounded corners.
    options:
    - A series of arches and columns
    - A rectangular panel above a sloping batter
    - A flat roof with decorative friezes
    - A stepped platform with rounded corners
