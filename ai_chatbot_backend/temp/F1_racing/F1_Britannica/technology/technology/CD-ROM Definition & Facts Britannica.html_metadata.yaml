- aspects:
  - content: A CD-ROM (Compact Disc Read-Only Memory) is a type of computer memory
      that uses an optical disc to store data. Unlike magnetic storage devices, CD-ROMs
      are read using a low-power laser beam that detects binary data encoded as tiny
      pits on the disc's surface. The data is then transferred to a computer for processing.
      The 'read-only' designation means that data cannot be modified or erased after
      it is written during manufacturing.
    type: definition
  - content: CD-ROMs utilize optical technology, specifically a laser beam, to read
      data. The data is encoded in the form of microscopic pits and lands on the disc,
      which the laser interprets as binary code. This method allows for precise and
      reliable data retrieval, but it also means the data is fixed and cannot be altered.
      The technology was adapted from the compact disc format originally developed
      for digital audio.
    type: technology
  - content: CD-ROMs have been widely used to distribute computer software, multimedia
      encyclopedias, large databases, and educational content. For example, early
      versions of Microsoft Encarta and many computer games were distributed on CD-ROMs.
      Their ability to store hundreds of megabytes made them ideal for content that
      exceeded the capacity of floppy disks.
    type: examples
  - content: The introduction of CD-ROMs revolutionized data distribution by enabling
      the mass production and widespread sharing of large digital files. However,
      their read-only nature limited their use for data backup or personal data storage,
      leading to the development of recordable and rewritable optical media.

    explanation: CD-ROMs use a laser to read binary data encoded as tiny pits on the
      surface of an optical disc, not magnetic heads, electrical charges, or ink.
    options:
    - By using a magnetic head to write and read data on a spinning disk
    - By using a laser to read binary data encoded as pits on an optical disc
    - By electrically charging cells within a silicon chip
    - By using ink to print data onto a paper surface
    question_text: Which of the following best describes how a CD-ROM stores and retrieves
      data?
  index: 130
  key_concept: CD-ROM definition and technology
  name: CD-ROM
- aspects:
  - content: The standard compact disc was introduced in 1982 for digital audio, but
      its digital storage capabilities led to its adaptation for computer use in the
      mid-1980s. The computer industry quickly adopted the CD-ROM as a low-cost, high-capacity
      storage medium for distributing large programs, graphics, and databases.
    type: context
  - content: CD-ROMs replaced floppy disks as the primary means of distributing large
      software packages and multimedia content. For instance, encyclopedias, educational
      games, and early multimedia applications were often shipped on CD-ROMs due to
      their substantial storage capacity.
    type: examples
  - content: The rapid commercial acceptance of CD-ROMs was driven by their storage
      capacity (680 MB) compared to floppy disks (1.4 MB). This allowed for more complex
      and content-rich software, fostering the growth of multimedia computing and
      more sophisticated applications.
    type: implications
  - content: The adoption of CD-ROMs is closely linked to the rise of multimedia PCs
      in the 1990s and the increasing demand for rich content in education and entertainment.
      Their success also paved the way for further innovations in optical storage.

  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: CD-ROMs were adopted because they provided much more storage capacity
      (680 MB) compared to floppy disks (1.4 MB), enabling the distribution of large
      programs and multimedia content.
    options:
    - They were less expensive to manufacture than floppy disks
    - They offered much higher storage capacity than floppy disks
    - They allowed users to record their own data easily
    - They were compatible with all existing magnetic storage devices
    question_text: Why did the computer industry adopt CD-ROMs in the mid-1980s?
  index: 130
  key_concept: Historical development and adoption
  name: CD-ROM
- aspects:
  - content: CD-ROMs are inherently read-only, meaning users cannot modify or add
      data once the disc is manufactured. This limitation made them unsuitable for
      personal data storage or frequent updates. Attempts to create recordable magnetic-optical
      hybrid devices were largely unsuccessful outside of publishing, due to incompatibility
      with standard players.
    type: limitations
  - content: To address the need for writable optical media, CD-Recordable (CD-R)
      and later CD-Rewritable (CD-RW) technologies were developed. CD-Rs use a light-sensitive
      dye that can be permanently altered by a laser to store data, while CD-RWs use
      a phase-change material that allows data to be rewritten multiple times. However,
      these formats initially required computers to operate and were mainly used for
      software distribution and data backup.
    type: evolution
  - content: The inability to rewrite data on standard CD-ROMs limited their versatility,
      prompting the industry to seek more flexible solutions. The evolution to CD-R
      and CD-RW enabled users to create their own discs, but adoption was initially
      limited by hardware requirements and compatibility issues.
    type: implications
  - content: The development of writable optical media reflects broader trends in
      data storage, including the demand for user-generated content and reliable backup
      solutions. These advances also set the stage for later technologies like DVDs
      and Blu-ray discs, which offered even greater capacity and flexibility.

    correct_answer:
    - 2
    explanation: Standard CD-ROMs are read-only and cannot be recorded or rewritten
      by users, prompting the development of CD-R (write-once) and CD-RW (rewritable)
      technologies.
    options:
    - They were too expensive to produce
    - They could not be read by computers
    - They were not recordable or rewritable by users
    - They had less storage than floppy disks
    question_text: What was a primary limitation of standard CD-ROMs that led to the
      development of CD-R and CD-RW?
  index: 130
  key_concept: Limitations and evolution of optical storage
  name: CD-ROM
- aspects:
  - content: As multimedia files grew larger, especially with the rise of computer
      games, educational software, and high-definition video, the storage capacity
      of CD-ROMs (680 MB) became insufficient. This led to the introduction of the
      digital videodisc (DVD) in 1995 and Blu-ray in 2002, both offering substantially
      greater storage.
    type: context
  - content: DVDs and Blu-ray discs could store several gigabytes of data, making
      them suitable for full-length movies, extensive software suites, and high-definition
      content. For example, feature films and complex video games transitioned from
      CD-ROM to DVD and later Blu-ray formats.
    type: examples
  - content: The increased storage needs of modern applications outpaced the capacity
      of CD-ROMs, resulting in their gradual obsolescence. The shift to DVDs and Blu-ray
      reflected the ongoing demand for higher-capacity, faster, and more versatile
      storage solutions.
    type: implications
  - content: The decline of CD-ROMs was further accelerated by advances in computer
      hard drives and the proliferation of high-speed Internet, which enabled digital
      distribution of large files. This marks a broader trend from physical to digital
      media in data storage and distribution.
