sections:
- aspects:
  - content: Diesel engines are internal combustion engines that operate using compression
      ignition, typically running on diesel fuel. They are known for their superior
      fuel economy compared to gasoline engines, largely due to higher thermal efficiency
      and energy density of diesel fuel. Diesel engines are commonly used in commercial
      vehicles, light trucks, and taxis, especially in regions with favorable tax
      incentives.
    type: Definition and Technical Features
  - content: After World War II, diesel engines gained popularity in Europe, particularly
      for light trucks and taxis, due to economic and policy advantages. In the 1970s,
      manufacturers like General Motors, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and Peugeot introduced
      diesel passenger cars in the United States, motivated by fuel shortages and
      high gasoline prices. However, the American market's enthusiasm waned in the
      1980s as fuel prices stabilized and diesel's drawbacks became apparent.
    type: Historical Development and Market Trends
  - content: Diesel engines historically suffered from issues such as noise, poor
      cold-weather starting, and limited fuel/service availability in some areas.
      These disadvantages contributed to a decline in demand, especially in the U.S.
      However, the development of common rail direct-injection diesel engines in the
      late 1990s improved environmental performance and efficiency, leading to a resurgence
      in Europe, where by 2005, diesel cars accounted for about half of all passenger
      car sales.
    type: Drawbacks and Technological Evolution
  - content: 'Tax incentives and fuel economy regulations played significant roles
      in the adoption of diesel vehicles in Europe. The environmental impact of diesel
      engines has been a double-edged sword: while they offer better fuel efficiency
      and lower CO2 emissions per kilometer, concerns over NOx and particulate emissions
      have led to stricter regulations and technological innovations.'
    type: Policy and Environmental Implications
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 0
    explanation: The initial popularity of diesel cars was due to fuel economy and
      policy incentives, but drawbacks like noise, poor cold-weather starting, and
      the return of low fuel prices led to a decline. There was no ban or widespread
      unavailability, and diesels were not chosen for acceleration or luxury.
    options:
    - Superior fuel economy and tax incentives initially encouraged adoption, but
      noise, poor cold-weather starting, and easing fuel prices reduced demand.
    - Diesel engines were banned in the U.S. due to safety concerns.
    - Diesel fuel became unavailable in most American states.
    - American consumers preferred diesel engines for their high acceleration and
      luxury features.

      cars in the United States after the 1970s?
  index: 311
  key_concept: Diesel
  name: '[Diesel](https://www.britannica.com/technology/diesel-fuel "https://www.britannica.com/technology/diesel-fuel")'
- aspects:
  - content: Electric vehicles (EVs) are powered exclusively by electric motors using
      energy stored in batteries. They are considered 'zero emission' vehicles at
      the point of use, as they do not emit exhaust gases during operation. Battery
      technology, especially lead-acid and later nickel–metal hydride cells, has been
      central to their development.
    type: Definition and Technical Overview
  - content: Interest in electric vehicles was revived in the United States during
      the 1973–74 fuel crisis, leading to the development of vehicles like the CitiCar
      by Sebring Vanguard. The CitiCar, produced in the mid-1970s, was a small, wedge-shaped,
      battery-powered car, and its successor, the ComutaCar, continued production
      into the early 1980s. These early EVs faced limitations in range and performance,
      and their popularity declined as oil prices dropped.
    type: Historical Context and Early Examples
  - content: Environmental concerns and regulatory mandates, such as the 1990 California
      Air Resources Board requirement for 'zero emission' vehicles, spurred further
      development. Automakers like General Motors and Ford produced battery electric
      vehicles for both consumers and government fleets. However, limited range (less
      than 100 miles with lead-acid batteries) and high costs for better batteries
      hindered widespread adoption, leading to a relaxation of mandates.
    type: Policy and Regulatory Influence
  - content: The primary challenges for electric vehicles have been limited driving
      range, high battery costs, and the need for charging infrastructure. Despite
      these issues, models like the Nissan LEAF and GM EV1 marked significant steps
      in EV commercialization. Advances in battery technology continue to be crucial
      for the future viability and mass adoption of electric vehicles.

- aspects:
  - content: Hybrid vehicles combine an internal combustion engine (typically gasoline)
      with an electric motor and battery system. Sophisticated control systems manage
      the interplay between the two power sources, allowing the vehicle to use electric
      power for low-speed driving and gasoline power for higher speeds or battery
      recharging. This design improves fuel economy and reduces emissions compared
      to conventional vehicles.
    type: Definition and Technical Operation
  - content: The Toyota Prius, introduced in Japan in 1997, was the first mass-market
      hybrid passenger car and became a global symbol of hybrid technology. Honda
      followed with the Insight in the U.S. market in 1999. Early hybrids benefited
      from government incentives, such as tax breaks and access to commuter lanes,
      which encouraged adoption.
    type: Historical Development and Market Introduction
  - content: Hybrids gained popularity, especially in environmentally conscious markets
      like California, where the Prius became a status symbol among celebrities and
      trendsetters. The removal of the need to plug in for recharging addressed a
      major drawback of pure electric vehicles, contributing to the appeal of hybrids.
      The Ford Escape Hybrid (SUV) was the first American hybrid, and luxury hybrids
      like the Lexus RX 400h followed.
    type: Market Impact and Consumer Reception
  - content: Hybrid technology has continued to evolve, with improvements in battery
      systems, control algorithms, and integration with vehicle platforms. The Chevrolet
      Volt introduced a plug-in hybrid concept, capable of running on electric power
      alone for a limited distance before switching to gasoline. The success of hybrids
      paved the way for further innovation, including the rise of fully electric vehicles
      from companies like Tesla.
    type: Technological Evolution and Legacy

  name: Electric-gasoline [hybrids](https://www.britannica.com/technology/hybrid-car
    "https://www.britannica.com/technology/hybrid-car")
- aspects:
  - content: Ethanol is an alcohol-based biofuel that can be blended with gasoline
      or used at high concentrations (E85) in specially designed FlexFuel Vehicles
      (FFVs). Fuel cells generate electricity through electrochemical reactions, typically
      using hydrogen as a fuel, and emit only water vapor as a byproduct. Both technologies
      are considered alternative energy solutions for reducing reliance on fossil
      fuels.
    type: Definition and Technical Characteristics
  - content: Brazil mandated that all new cars sold from 2003 be FFVs capable of running
      on gasoline with up to 85% ethanol. This policy led to widespread adoption of
      ethanol-compatible vehicles and influenced global manufacturers to certify models
      as E85-compliant. In the U.S., the eighth character of the VIN indicates E85
      compatibility. Major American automakers have focused on fuel cell development,
      supported by government grants.
    type: Policy Initiatives and Market Adoption
  - content: While ethanol FFVs are commercially available and widely used in Brazil,
      fuel cell vehicles remain in the research and development phase, with broad
      public availability still years away. Fuel cells face challenges including hydrogen
      production, storage, and infrastructure, while ethanol's sustainability depends
      on agricultural practices and energy balance.
    type: Technological and Practical Limitations
  - content: Ethanol and fuel cells offer potential reductions in greenhouse gas emissions
      and diversification of energy sources. Ethanol production can support agricultural
      economies but raises concerns about land use and food prices. Fuel cells promise
      clean operation but require significant investment in hydrogen infrastructure
      and technology maturation.
