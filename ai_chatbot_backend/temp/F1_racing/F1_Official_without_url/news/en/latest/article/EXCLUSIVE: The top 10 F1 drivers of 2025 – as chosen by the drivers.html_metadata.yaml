sections:
- aspects:
  - content: The Drivers' Driver of the Year vote is an annual peer-based ranking
      where Formula 1 drivers anonymously rate and rank their top 10 fellow competitors
      from the season. This process is in its eighth edition and aims to recognize
      outstanding performance as judged by the athletes themselves, rather than external
      media or fans.
    type: Definition
  - content: 'Each participating driver submits a confidential list ranking their
      top 10 drivers of the season. The F1 points system is used to assign scores:
      25 points for the top spot down to 1 point for 10th place. Drivers are allowed
      to vote for themselves, but many choose not to or do not place themselves first.
      The cumulative points from all ballots determine the overall top 10.'
    type: Voting Mechanics
  - content: This peer-driven ranking carries unique prestige since it reflects the
      respect and recognition of fellow competitors. It can highlight drivers whose
      performances may not have translated into championship points due to machinery
      limitations, and it sometimes differs from official standings or media-driven
      awards. The secrecy of the vote encourages honest assessments.
    type: Implications and Significance
  - content: In 2025, Max Verstappen was voted driver of the year for the fifth consecutive
      time, even though he did not win the championship. Notably, Lewis Hamilton,
      a seven-time World Champion, failed to make the top 10 for the first time, illustrating
      how peer perception can shift with performance. The process also allows for
      rookies or drivers from less competitive teams to receive recognition.

    type: Key Examples and Achievements
  - content: The ranking highlights how peer perception can value factors beyond just
      points, such as overcoming adversity, maximizing machinery, and racecraft. For
      example, Carlos Sainz was acknowledged for his strong second half despite a
      team change, and Alex Albon for his best-ever season with Williams. The inclusion
      of rookies and the exclusion of veterans like Lewis Hamilton reflect the dynamic
      nature of performance evaluation among peers.

  name: 'EXCLUSIVE: The top 10 F1 drivers of 2025 – as chosen by the drivers'
- aspects:
  - content: Peer recognition in F1 refers to how drivers are evaluated by their fellow
      competitors, which can differ significantly from official championship standings
      determined by points. The Drivers' Driver of the Year vote is an example of
      such peer-based recognition.
    type: Definition and Distinction
  - content: In 2025, Max Verstappen was ranked first by his peers despite finishing
      second in the championship, while Lando Norris, the actual title winner, was
      ranked second. Similarly, Lewis Hamilton, a historically successful driver,
      was omitted from the top 10 due to a challenging season, highlighting that peer
      respect is contingent on current performance.
    type: Examples of Divergence
  - content: Being highly rated by peers can enhance a driver's reputation, potentially
      influencing contract negotiations, sponsorships, and legacy. Conversely, a lack
      of peer recognition may signal a need for improvement or adaptation, regardless
      of past achievements.
    type: Implications for Drivers' Careers
  - content: Peer recognition can boost morale within teams and foster a culture of
      mutual respect. It may also affect intra-team dynamics if a driver is seen as
      undervalued or overvalued by their colleagues, influencing team strategies and
      support.
