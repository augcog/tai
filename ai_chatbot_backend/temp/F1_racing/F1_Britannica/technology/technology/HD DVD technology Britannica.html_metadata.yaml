- aspects:
  - content: HD DVD (High Definition Digital Versatile Disc) is an optical disc format
      developed for the storage and playback of high-definition video and data. It
      was proposed by Toshiba and NEC Corporation as a successor to the standard DVD
      format, aiming to provide higher storage capacity and improved video quality.
    type: definition
  - content: HD DVD emerged in the early 2000s as a competing standard to Blu-ray
      in the race to replace the DVD format for high-definition content. The format
      war between HD DVD and Blu-ray was significant in shaping the future of home
      video technology, with industry alliances and studio support playing critical
      roles.
    type: context
  - content: The introduction of HD DVD represented a major technological leap in
      optical storage, enabling the distribution of high-definition movies and other
      large data files. However, the format's eventual loss to Blu-ray in the market
      had lasting effects on consumer electronics, content distribution, and industry
      standards.

  name: HD DVD
- aspects:
  - content: Blue-violet laser technology refers to the use of lasers that emit light
      in the blue-violet region of the visible spectrum, typically around 405 nanometres.
      This technology enables the reading and writing of data on optical discs with
      much greater precision than red lasers used in DVDs.
    type: definition
  - content: Both HD DVD and Blu-ray discs utilize blue-violet lasers, which allow
      for smaller pits and more closely spaced tracks on the disc surface. This results
      in higher data density and greater storage capacity compared to traditional
      DVDs.
    type: examples
  - content: The adoption of blue-violet lasers was a key factor in the advancement
      of optical disc technology, enabling the transition from standard to high-definition
      video formats. It also set the stage for future developments in optical storage
      media.

  name: compact discs
- aspects:
  - content: Data density in optical discs refers to the amount of information that
      can be stored per unit area on the disc surface. Advancements in laser technology,
      specifically the move to shorter-wavelength blue-violet lasers, enabled significant
      increases in data density.
    type: definition
  - content: While standard DVDs used red lasers and had limited data density, HD
      DVD and Blu-ray discs used blue-violet lasers to achieve much higher capacities.
      For example, a standard single-layer DVD holds about 4.7 GB, while single-layer
      Blu-ray discs can store 25 GB or more.
    type: examples
  - content: Increased data density allowed for the storage and playback of high-definition
      video and large data files on optical discs, revolutionizing home entertainment
      and data archiving. It also pushed the boundaries of optical engineering and
      manufacturing.
