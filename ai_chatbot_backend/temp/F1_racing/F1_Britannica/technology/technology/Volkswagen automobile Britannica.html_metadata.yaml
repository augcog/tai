      and rapidly scale its output.
    type: Definition
  - content: At the end of World War II, much of Germany's industrial infrastructure
      was devastated. The Volkswagen plant, located in Wolfsburg, was a prime example,

  - content: Within just over a decade after the war, Volkswagen's Wolfsburg plant
      was producing half of West Germany's motor vehicles. This rapid recovery not
      only revitalized the company but also contributed significantly to the postwar
      German economic miracle, known as the Wirtschaftswunder.
    type: Production Impact
  - content: Volkswagen's resurgence positioned it as a dominant force in the European
      automotive industry. The company's ability to quickly ramp up production and
