sections:
- aspects:
  - content: Stainless steel is a family of alloy steels that typically contain 10
      to 30 percent chromium and low carbon content. The inclusion of chromium imparts
      significant resistance to both corrosion and heat, distinguishing stainless
      steel from ordinary steel. Stainless steel also frequently includes other elements
      such as nickel, molybdenum, titanium, aluminum, niobium, copper, nitrogen, sulfur,
      phosphorus, or selenium to enhance specific properties or adapt to particular
      environments.
    type: definition
  - content: The core composition of stainless steel centers on chromium, with other
      elements added for tailored properties. Manufacturing usually involves melting
      in electric-arc or basic oxygen furnaces, followed by refining to reduce carbon
      content. The argon-oxygen decarburization process is particularly important,
      as it allows for the controlled removal of carbon without oxidizing valuable
      chromium, enabling the use of cost-effective raw materials like high-carbon
      ferrochromium.
    type: composition and manufacturing
  - content: Stainless steel's corrosion and heat resistance make it essential in
      industries such as food processing, dairy, chemical processing, construction,
      and medical instruments. Its unique properties reduce maintenance costs and
      increase the longevity of products. Edge cases include environments with highly
      specific corrosion challenges, where additional alloying elements are selected
      to meet those demands.
    type: applications and implications
  - content: Stainless steel is closely related to other alloy steels but is set apart
      by its chromium content and resulting corrosion resistance. It connects to concepts
      such as alloys, corrosion science, and industrial metallurgy. Its subtypes—such
      as austenitic, ferritic, martensitic, duplex, and precipitation-hardening—highlight
      the diversity of stainless steels and their tailored uses.

    - A steel alloy with no added elements for corrosion resistance.
    question_text: Which of the following best describes stainless steel?
  index: 146
  key_concept: stainless steel
  name: stainless steel
- aspects:
  - content: 'Stainless steels are classified into five major groups: austenitic,
      ferritic, martensitic, duplex, and precipitation-hardening. Each group is defined
      by its microstructure, alloying elements, and resulting properties. There are
      more than 100 grades, but these five families cover the most commonly used types.'
    type: classification
  - content: Austenitic steels (e.g., 304 or 18/8) are nonmagnetic, not hardenable
      by heat treatment, and have high corrosion resistance. Ferritic steels are nickel-free,
      contain 10.5–27% chromium, and are used in less demanding corrosion environments.
      Martensitic steels are hardenable by heat treatment, contain 11.5–18% chromium,
      and are used for cutlery and tools. Duplex steels combine austenitic and ferritic
      structures for higher strength and corrosion resistance. Precipitation-hardening
      steels gain strength from small additions of elements like aluminum and copper.
    type: examples and distinguishing features
  - content: Austenitic steels are widely used in food processing, dairy, and aircraft
      industries due to their corrosion resistance. Ferritic steels are chosen for
      architectural and automotive trim. Martensitic steels are used for blades, surgical
      instruments, and turbines. Duplex steels are favored for storage tanks and chemical
      transport due to their enhanced strength and resistance. Precipitation-hardening
      steels are used in applications requiring high strength, such as long shafts.
    type: practical implications and use cases
  - content: The classification of stainless steel types is closely linked to their
      alloy content and resulting physical properties, such as magnetism, hardenability,
      and corrosion resistance. Understanding these types helps engineers and designers
      select the appropriate material for specific environmental and mechanical demands.

    correct_answer:
    - 3
    explanation: Bainitic is not a major group of stainless steel; the five major
      groups are austenitic, ferritic, martensitic, duplex, and precipitation-hardening.
    options:
    - Austenitic
    - Ferritic
    - Martensitic
    - Bainitic
    question_text: Which of the following is NOT a major group of stainless steel?
  index: 146
  key_concept: types of stainless steel
  name: stainless steel
- aspects:
  - content: Chromium is the key element in stainless steel that provides resistance
      to corrosion and heat. When present in concentrations of 10–30%, chromium reacts
      with oxygen at the surface to form a thin, stable, and self-healing oxide layer
      that protects the underlying metal from further oxidation and corrosion.
    type: role and mechanism
  - content: In typical stainless steels, chromium content ranges from 10% to 30%.
      For example, austenitic stainless steels contain 16–26% chromium. The presence
      of chromium allows stainless steel to be used in harsh environments, such as
      chemical processing and food industries, where ordinary steel would corrode
      rapidly.
    type: examples and effects
  - content: The effectiveness of chromium in providing corrosion resistance depends
      on its concentration and the presence of other elements. In environments with
      aggressive chemicals or high salinity, higher chromium content or additional
      elements like molybdenum may be required. Chromium also raises the cost of the
      alloy but is essential for stainless properties.
    type: implications and edge cases
  - content: While chromium is the primary element for corrosion resistance, other
      elements such as nickel and molybdenum are often added to improve specific properties
      like toughness, formability, or resistance to particular types of corrosion.
      The interplay between chromium and these elements determines the final characteristics
      of the stainless steel.

  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: Chromium is added to stainless steel primarily to provide resistance
      to corrosion and heat, not for conductivity, magnetism, or lowering the melting
      point.
    options:
    - To increase electrical conductivity
    - To impart corrosion and heat resistance
    - To make the steel magnetic
    - To reduce the melting point
    question_text: What is the primary reason chromium is added to stainless steel?
  index: 146
  key_concept: chromium in stainless steel
  name: stainless steel
- aspects:
  - content: Austenitic stainless steels are characterized by high chromium (16–26%)
      and nickel (up to 35%) content. They are nonmagnetic and cannot be hardened
      by heat treatment. The most common grade is 18/8 (304), with 18% chromium and
      8% nickel.
    type: definition and composition
  - content: Austenitic steels have the highest general corrosion resistance among
      stainless steels due to their high chromium and nickel content. The passive
      oxide layer formed by chromium is particularly stable in these alloys, making
      them suitable for use in aggressive environments.
    type: corrosion resistance and properties
  - content: The 18/8 (304) grade is widely used in the dairy and food-processing
      industries, as well as in aircraft manufacturing, due to its excellent corrosion
      resistance and formability. These steels are also used in chemical processing
      equipment and kitchenware.
    type: examples and applications
  - content: While austenitic steels have high general corrosion resistance, in environments
      containing chlorides (like seawater), specialized grades with added molybdenum
      (such as 316) are preferred to prevent pitting corrosion. Austenitic steels
      are not hardenable by heat treatment, which limits their use in applications
      requiring high hardness.
    type: implications and edge cases
  - content: Compared to ferritic and martensitic steels, austenitic steels offer
      superior corrosion resistance but are generally more expensive due to higher
      nickel content. Duplex steels may surpass austenitics in certain corrosion scenarios,
      but austenitic remains the most widely used for general corrosion resistance.
