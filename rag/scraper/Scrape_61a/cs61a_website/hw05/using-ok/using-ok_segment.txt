h1: Using Ok
Contents:

CS 61A uses a program called `ok` to test and submit homework
assignments, labs, and projects.

Every programming assignment will include a `.zip` archive that
contains the following:

* Starter code
* A copy of `ok`

After extracting the contents of the archive, you can begin your
assignment.


=====================================

h2: Signing in with Ok
Contents:

To get started, open your terminal, and `cd` into the right directory
(you should see a file called `ok` when you `ls` in the right
directory).

Try the following command:

```
python3 ok
```

This runs the tests (don't worry if the tests fail at first; you
haven't written code yet!).

The first time you run `ok`, you will be asked for your bCourses email.
This should be your Berkeley email address (ending with `@berkeley.edu`).
If you have more than one, please use the one that you log into your
bConnected Google account with.

If you don't have a Berkeley email address, you can create one
[here](https://mybconnected.berkeley.edu/my/account/index "https://mybconnected.berkeley.edu/my/account/index") by logging
in to your CalNet account.

After typing in your email, your web browser will open an
authentication page. Click "Accept" to authenticate `ok`.

h3: Troubleshooting
Contents:


=====================================

h4: Not enrolled
Contents:

If you see an error message that indicates you are not enrolled in the course,
make sure you are using the email address that would appear on the course
roster. If the email you used is correct, you may continue to use the email;
your submissions will still be saved. You must contact your TA for that email
address to be enrolled.


=====================================

h4: Wrong email
Contents:

If you typed your email incorrectly, you can re-authenticate with the following
command:

```
python3 ok --authenticate
```


=====================================

h4: Can't authenticate/browser issues/redirections to `127.0.0.1`/etc.
Contents:

Try running with `--no-browser`:

```
python3 ok --authenticate --no-browser
```

Also, double-check your internet connection. If you're on campus, try using
[eduroam](https://technology.berkeley.edu/wi-fi "https://technology.berkeley.edu/wi-fi").


=====================================

h4: Crashed or did not load
Contents:

Make sure you have the 64-bit version of Python 3 installed. You can check
whether you have the incorrect 32-bit version by running the following command
in your terminal.

```
python3 -c "import struct,platform;print(8 * struct.calcsize('P'), platform.python_version())"
```


=====================================

h2: Testing with Ok
Contents:

After writing some code, you can test your code with `ok` in various
ways.


=====================================

h3: Test specific questions
Contents:

To test a specific question, use the `-q` option with the name of the question:

```
python3 ok -q ### Q1
```


=====================================

h3: Test all questions
Contents:

You can run all the tests with the following command:

```
python3 ok
```


=====================================

h3: Display all tests
Contents:

By default, only tests that **fail** will appear. If you want to see how you did
on all tests, you can use the `-v` option:

```
python3 ok -v
```


=====================================

h3: Test locally
Contents:

If you do not want to send your progress to our server or you have any problems
logging in, add the `--local` flag to block all communication:

```
python3 ok --local
```


=====================================

h3: Adding your own tests
Contents:

![Adding Tests](assets/custom-test.png)
You can write your own tests and run them using `ok`. By default, a test file
will be named `mytests.rst`. You may use a different name, but you will need to
specify it when running tests.


=====================================

h3: Running your own tests
Contents:

To run all your tests in `mytests.rst` with verbose results:

```
python3 ok -t -v
```

If you put your tests in a different file or split your tests up into multiple
files:

```
python3 ok -t your_new_filename.rst
```

To run just the tests from suite 1 case 1 in `mytests.rst`:

```
python3 ok -t --suite 1 --case 1
```

You might have noticed that there's a "test coverage" percentage for your tests
(note that coverage statistics are only returned when running all tests). This
is a measure of your test's
[code coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage").

To receive guidance on which lines you should test to increase your coverage:

```
python3 ok -t -cov
```

Code coverage won't include `ok` tests, so the coverage percentage might be
higher in reality.

While code coverage is a useful tool, you should not get fixated on this number.
It is better to write tests that help you complete the problem and make life
easier instead of achieving a higher coverage.


=====================================

h3: Submit assignment
Contents:

When you are ready to submit, run `ok` with the `--submit` option:

```
python3 ok --submit
```

After submitting, `ok` will display a submission URL, with which you can view
your submission on [okpy.org](https://okpy.org "https://okpy.org").


=====================================

h2: Viewing submissions
Contents:

You can go to [okpy.org](https://okpy.org "https://okpy.org") to check your submissions and backups. Make sure you
sign in with the same bCourses email that you authenticated with.
