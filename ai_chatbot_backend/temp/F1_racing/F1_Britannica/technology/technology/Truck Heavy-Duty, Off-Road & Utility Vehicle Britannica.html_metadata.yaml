  - content: A truck is defined as any motor vehicle designed to carry freight or
      goods, or to perform special services such as firefighting. Trucks are distinct
      from passenger vehicles due to their primary function of transporting goods
      or performing specialized tasks.
    type: Definition
  - content: The development of trucks originated from horse-drawn wagon technology,
      with early manufacturers often transitioning from the wagon business. The first
      motor truck was built by Gottlieb Daimler in 1896 in Germany, featuring a four-horsepower
      engine and belt drive. In the United States, the Winton Company produced a gasoline-powered
      delivery wagon in 1898. Trucks became especially prominent during World War
      I and II, where they replaced horse-drawn equipment for military logistics,
      exemplified by the introduction of the jeep.
    type: Historical Context
  - content: Notable examples in truck evolution include the four-wheel-drive, quarter-ton-capacity
      jeep used in WWII. By the late 20th century, the U.S. market saw a surge in
      light trucks, including utility and sport utility vehicles, which became popular
      as family vehicles. This trend was unique to the American market, as trucks
      elsewhere remained primarily commercial.
    type: Examples and Evolution
  - content: The evolution of trucks reflects broader trends in technology, transportation
      infrastructure, and consumer behavior. The shift from wagons to motorized trucks
      paralleled improvements in road networks, especially in North America and Europe,
      allowing trucks to dominate intercity and intracity freight delivery. The American
      preference for light trucks as personal vehicles also highlights cultural and
      regulatory differences in vehicle classification.

  name: truck
- aspects:
  - content: Trucks are classified as either straight or articulated. A straight truck
      has all axles attached to a single frame, while an articulated vehicle consists
      of two or more frames connected by couplings. Key subtypes include truck tractors
      (for drawing trailers), semitrailers (with part of their weight supported by
      the tractor), and full trailers (which support their own weight).
    type: Definition and Main Types
  - content: Truck tractors connect to semitrailers via a fifth wheel, which includes
      a trunnion plate and latching mechanism. Semitrailers can be converted to full
      trailers using a trailer-converter dolly. Heavy trucks may have multiple powered
      axles, and axle spacing affects whether an assembly is called a spread tandem.
      Examples include long-haul tractor-trailers and construction vehicles.
    type: Technical Features and Examples
  - content: In the U.S., trucks are regulated by gross vehicle weight (GVW). Light
      trucks have GVWs up to 10,000 pounds, medium trucks range from 10,000 to 26,000
      pounds, and heavy-duty haulers exceed 26,000 pounds. These classifications affect
      usage, regulatory standards, and taxation.
    type: Regulatory and Weight Classifications
  - content: Truck classification impacts vehicle design, regulatory compliance, and
      operational roles. For example, light trucks often resemble passenger vehicles
      and are used as family cars in the U.S., while heavy-duty trucks are essential
      for commercial freight and construction. Understanding these distinctions is
      crucial for logistics, transportation policy, and automotive engineering.
