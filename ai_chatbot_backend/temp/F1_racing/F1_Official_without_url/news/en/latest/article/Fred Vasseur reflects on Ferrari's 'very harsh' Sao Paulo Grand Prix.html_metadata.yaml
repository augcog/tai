- aspects:
  - content: A double DNF (Did Not Finish) refers to both cars from a team failing
      to complete a race. At the 2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix, both Ferrari drivers,
      Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton, retired from the race due to separate incidents,
      resulting in no points scored for the team.
    type: Definition
  - content: Leclerc was forced to retire after a collision involving Kimi Antonelli
      and Oscar Piastri, which led to a lost tyre. Hamilton’s race ended after contact
      with Carlos Sainz and later Franco Colapinto, causing significant car damage
      and a five-second penalty. Both incidents exemplify the unpredictable and high-risk
      nature of F1 racing.
    type: Examples
  - content: A double DNF is particularly damaging in the context of the Constructors’
      Championship, as it means the team scores no points while rivals can capitalize.
      For Ferrari, this result put them at a disadvantage in their battle with Mercedes
      and Red Bull for second place, with only three races remaining in the season.
    type: Implications
  - content: Double DNFs are rare but critical events in F1, often leading to intense
      scrutiny of team strategy, driver decisions, and external factors such as race
      incidents. The Sao Paulo GP was especially harsh for Ferrari given their competitive
      position and the late stage of the season.
    type: Context

      mentioned.

- aspects:
  - content: Championship standings in Formula 1 refer to the ranking of teams and
      drivers based on accumulated points over the season. Each race result can significantly
      alter the relative positions, especially in closely contested battles.
    type: Definition
  - content: After the double DNF, Ferrari dropped to fourth in the Teams’ Standings,
      falling 36 points behind Mercedes and four behind Red Bull. This demonstrates
      how a single race can dramatically change the competitive landscape, especially
      near the end of the season.
    type: Examples
  - content: Losing points at a critical stage can have lasting consequences, reducing
      a team's chances for a higher championship finish and associated financial and
      reputational rewards. Ferrari’s zero score put them at a strategic disadvantage
      with only three rounds left.
    type: Implications
  - content: Championship standings are interconnected with race results, team strategies,
      and driver performances. Incidents like double DNFs not only affect the current

- aspects:
  - content: Race incidents in F1 refer to on-track events such as collisions or rule
      infractions, often resulting in penalties. Penalties can include time additions,
      drive-throughs, or disqualifications, and are imposed to ensure fair competition.
    type: Definition
  - content: Leclerc’s retirement was due to a collision involving Antonelli and Piastri,
      with Piastri receiving a 10-second penalty. Hamilton was penalized five seconds
      for his contact with Colapinto after being hit by Sainz earlier, showing how
      multiple incidents can compound a driver’s race difficulties.
    type: Examples
  - content: Penalties can drastically change race outcomes, affecting both individual
      drivers and team results. For Ferrari, the combination of incidents and penalties
      led to both cars retiring, highlighting how race management and incident avoidance
      are crucial.

  - content: Sometimes, penalties are debated for fairness or severity. In this event,
      Vasseur avoided assigning blame for Leclerc’s incident, focusing instead on
