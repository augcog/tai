      formal sponsorship or partnership agreements with the Formula 1 organization.
      These relationships typically involve financial support, co-marketing, and brand
      integration within F1 events, broadcasts, and digital platforms. The partnership
      status confers exclusive rights and visibility within the sport’s global ecosystem.
    type: Definition
  - content: Current official partners include luxury brands (LVMH, Louis Vuitton,
      Moet Hennessy), technology companies (AWS, Lenovo, Salesforce, Globant), beverage
      companies (Heineken, PepsiCo), financial services (American Express, Santander),
      logistics (DHL), airlines (Qatar Airways), and others such as Pirelli, Aramco,
      Crypto.com, MSC, Barilla, Liqui Moly, Nestle, PwC, Allwyn, Paramount+, Las Vegas
      Convention and Visitors Authority, Puma, TATA, Aggreko, BBS, and McDonalds.

      media.
    type: Examples
  - content: 'Partnerships are leveraged for mutual benefit: F1 gains financial resources
      and technical support, while partners access F1’s global audience for marketing,
      product placement, and hospitality opportunities. For example, AWS provides
      cloud computing and data analytics, Pirelli supplies tires, and DHL manages
      logistics for the race calendar. These collaborations can extend to fan engagement
      campaigns, exclusive content, and event activations.'
    type: Use Cases

      and its ability to attract diverse industries. These relationships can influence
      the sport’s technological advancement, sustainability initiatives, and overall

      data analysis, while sustainability-focused partners can help F1 meet environmental
      targets.

      in broadcast graphics, digital content, and at-track signage. They may also
