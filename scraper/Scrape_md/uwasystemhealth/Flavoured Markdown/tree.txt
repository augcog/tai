#Flavoured Markdown (h1)

Flavoured markdown is a type of markdown that is customised with different syntax to provide a more stylistic documentationn. As you know, markdown is great for its simplicity, however this also makes it inflexible when making more stylistic documentation such as creating Math formula with Latex and many more feature that you wil see here. With Flavoured Markdown, there are certain syntax to follow on top of the original markdown syntax.

Below is a **very very small** overview to what[Mkdocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) - the base extension . I will just highlight some of them, because those are the only documentation syntax that is commonly use and usually remembered.



##Admonitions (h2)
These are kind of those fancy boxes that you usually in cool Science Books that adds extra information.

If things are getting a little bit crowded, why not make some of them collapsible?

??? Example "Example of a More Complex Documentation"
    Here is the basic idea of bubble sort!
    ```python
    def bubble_sort(items):
        for i in range(len(items)):
            for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i):
                if items[j] > items[j + 1]:
                    items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j]

##Code Highlight (h2)
This is powered by codehilite. Whenever, you need code, this is the one that makes it pretty.

*For example:*
``` python
def bubble_sort(items):
    for i in range(len(items)):
        for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i):
            if items[j] > items[j + 1]:
                items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j]
```

??? Example "Syntax of the Example Above"
    ```markdown
        ``` python linenums="1"
        def bubble_sort(items):
            for i in range(len(items)):
                for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i):
                    if items[j] > items[j + 1]:
                        items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j]
        ```
    ```



###Highlight Specific Code Lines (h3)
What if I want to show some cool lines?
I could highlight which specific line number should be highlighted.

``` python hl_lines="2 3"
def bubble_sort(items):
    for i in range(len(items)):
        for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i):
            if items[j] > items[j + 1]:
                items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j]
```

??? Example "Syntax of the Example Above"
    ```markdown
        ``` python hl_lines="2 3"
        def bubble_sort(items):
            for i in range(len(items)):
                for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i):
                    if items[j] > items[j + 1]:
                        items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j]

##Latex / Math Symbol Renderer (h2)
This is for math nerds that needs some Maths in their documentation. More info on Latex [here](http://www.icl.utk.edu/~mgates3/docs/latex.pdf).

For example, the Pythagoras Theorem
$$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$

??? Example "Syntax of the Example Above"
    ```latex
    $$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$
    ```



###Inline Latex (h3)
According to the results with the p-value $p < 0.05$, it means that we will reject the null Hypothesis $H_0$, and that there is a significant difference in the means.

Very useful for when you need one or the other.

For example, when dealing with multiple programming languages.

    ``` c
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void) {
      printf("Hello world!\n");
      return 0;
    }
    ```

    ``` c++
    #include <iostream>

    int main(void) {
      std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
      return 0;
    }
    ```

            printf("Hello world!\n");
            return 0;

3. Save this graph that you want to show
4. Upload this graph somewhere
5. Link this image back to this documentation

Like there are just soooo many steps.

3. Save this graph that you want to show
4. Upload this graph somewhere
5. Link this image back to this documentation

Like there are just soooo many steps.

Introducing **mermaid markdown**.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A --> B & C
    B --> C
```

??? Example "Syntax for Above"
    ```markdown
        ```mermaid
        graph TD
            A --> B & C
            B --> C
        ```
    ```

How about more complex ones? Is this complex enough for your

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Hard] -->|Text| B(Round)
    B --> C{Decision}
    C -->|One| D[Result 1]
    C -->|Two| E[Result 2]
```

??? Example "Syntax for Above"
    ```markdown
        ```mermaid
        graph TD
            A[Hard] -->|Text| B(Round)
            B --> C{Decision}
            C -->|One| D[Result 1]
            C -->|Two| E[Result 2]
        ```
    ```

=== "Result"
    ```mermaid
    classDiagram
    Class01 <|-- AveryLongClass : Cool
    Class03 *-- Class04
    Class05 o-- Class06
    Class07 .. Class08
    Class09 --> C2 : Where am i?
    Class09 --* C3
    Class09 --|> Class07
    Class07 : equals()
    Class07 : Object[] elementData
    Class01 : size()
    Class01 : int chimp
    Class01 : int gorilla
    Class08 <--> C2: Cool label
