  - content: An operating system (OS) is a software program that manages a computer’s
      resources, including the CPU, memory, file storage, input/output devices, and
      network connections. It acts as an intermediary between hardware and other software,
      ensuring efficient and fair allocation of resources among running programs.
      Unlike typical programs, an OS runs continuously from system start-up to shutdown.
    type: Definition
  - content: Examples of operating systems include Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux,
      iOS, and Android. Each of these systems manages resources and provides services
      tailored to different types of devices, such as personal computers, servers,
