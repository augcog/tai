- aspects:
  - content: A computer network is defined as two or more computers connected to each
      other for the purpose of communicating data electronically. The connection can
      include various devices and is not limited to computers alone; it may also involve
      communication devices and peripherals. The network enables the transfer of information
      between diverse types of equipment, allowing them to operate together in a cohesive
      system.
    type: definition
  - content: Network architecture refers to the design and structure that enables
      communication and data transfer among connected devices. Two prominent architectures
      mentioned are the ISO Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model and IBM's Systems
      Network Architecture (SNA). These architectures provide standardized frameworks
      for how data is transmitted, received, and interpreted across different devices
      and systems, ensuring interoperability and efficient communication.
    type: network architecture
  - content: The architecture of a computer network is crucial for seamless information
      exchange, supporting interoperability among various hardware and software platforms.
      Adopting standard architectures like OSI or SNA allows for scalability, easier
      troubleshooting, and integration of new technologies. Network architecture also
      determines the security, reliability, and efficiency of data transfer, impacting
      everything from small office networks to global systems like the Internet.

    explanation: A computer network is primarily defined as a group of computers connected
      for data communication, but the article also emphasizes the importance of a
      cohesive architecture that allows different equipment types to transfer information
      seamlessly. The network is not limited to only computers (option 1 is incorrect),
      and while OSI is a popular architecture, it is not the only one (option 3 is
      incorrect).
    options:
    - A group of computers physically connected for data communication.
    - A system where only computers can communicate electronically.
    - A cohesive architecture allowing various equipment types to transfer information
      seamlessly.
    - A network using only the OSI model for communication.
    question_text: Which of the following best describes a computer network according
      to the article?
  index: 143
  key_concept: computer network definition and architecture
  name: computer network
- aspects:
  - content: Local Area Networks (LANs) are networks that connect computers and peripheral
      devices within a limited geographic area, such as an office, laboratory, or
      campus. They use physical links like wires, Ethernet cables, fiber optics, or
      Wi-Fi to enable rapid data transmission among connected devices.
    type: definition
  - content: A typical LAN setup includes two or more personal computers, printers,
      and high-capacity disk-storage devices known as file servers. These file servers
      allow each computer on the network to access a shared set of files. LANs are
      also managed by operating system software that interprets input and coordinates
      communication between devices, enabling users to share resources like printers
      and storage equipment.
    type: examples and components
  - content: LANs facilitate efficient resource sharing, collaborative work, and centralized
      data management within organizations. They can be interconnected with other
      LANs or WANs for broader access. LANs with similar architectures are linked
      using 'bridges,' while those with different architectures use 'gateways' to
      convert data formats, ensuring compatibility and communication across diverse
      systems.
    type: practical implications and connections

    - 3
    explanation: LANs connect devices within a limited area, not large regions (option
      0 is incorrect). They use bridges and gateways to link similar or different
      architectures, and are managed by operating system software that enables resource
      sharing, including printers and storage devices (option 2 is incorrect).
    options:
    - LANs connect computers over large geographic regions.
    - LANs use devices like bridges and gateways to link different architectures.
    - LANs typically do not allow sharing of printers or storage devices.
    - LANs are managed by specialized operating system software.
    question_text: Which statement accurately characterizes a Local Area Network (LAN)
      as described in the article?
  index: 143
  key_concept: local area networks (LANs)
  name: computer network
- aspects:
  - content: Wide Area Networks (WANs) are networks that connect computers and smaller
      networks across extensive geographic areas, often spanning cities, countries,
      or even continents. WANs enable communication and resource sharing over long
      distances, typically using cables, fiber optics, or satellite links.
    type: definition
  - content: WANs may link computers and networks via various transmission media,
      including telephone lines (using modems), fiber optics, or satellites. The largest
      and most well-known WAN is the Internet, which connects billions of users and
      devices worldwide through a vast collection of interconnected networks and gateways.
    type: examples and components
  - content: WANs are essential for enabling global communication, supporting business
      operations across multiple locations, and providing access to remote resources.
      They often incorporate multiple LANs and smaller networks, using gateways to
      translate data between different network architectures. WANs are fundamental
      to services like email, cloud computing, and international data exchange.
    type: practical implications and connections
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: WANs are characterized by their ability to connect computers and
      networks over large geographic distances, often using modems and satellites.
      Unlike LANs, which are confined to small areas, WANs can span continents. WANs
      can also interconnect with LANs and are not limited to a few computers.
