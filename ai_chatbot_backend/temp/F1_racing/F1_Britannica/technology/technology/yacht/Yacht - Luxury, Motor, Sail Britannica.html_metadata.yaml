sections:
- aspects:
  - content: Power yachts are pleasure vessels propelled by mechanical engines, initially
      steam and later internal-combustion engines. The transition from sail to steam
      in the mid-19th century marked the beginning of power yachting, with paddle-wheel
      boats giving way to screw or propeller-driven vessels. Over time, the development
      of reliable gasoline and diesel engines led to the predominance of exclusively
      powered yachts, though auxiliary yachts (with both sail and power) remained
      popular for a period.
    type: Definition and Evolution
  - content: The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a boom in large steam yacht
      construction, exemplified by the Mayflower (1897) and the Orion (1930). The
      Sea Cloud (1931) represented the largest auxiliary yacht of its time. After
      1932, the trend shifted towards smaller, more affordable yachts, especially
      following World War II, when surplus naval vessels were converted for private
      use.
    type: Historical Examples and Trends
  - content: Initially, power yachting was a pastime of the wealthy due to the high
      cost and size of early yachts. As engine technology improved and costs decreased,
      yachting became accessible to a broader population, leading to a surge in ownership
      and participation, especially on inland waterways and lakes. This democratization
      of yachting paralleled broader social changes in leisure and recreation.

  - content: Yacht racing has been part of the Olympic Games since 1900 (except 1904),
      reflecting the sport's international prestige. Over time, the Olympic program
      shifted from races for boats of various sizes to a focus on smaller boats and
      standardized classes, especially after World War II.
    type: Inclusion and Evolution
  - content: Olympic yacht racing typically features five classes, including monotype
      (one-person), two-person centerboard and keel boats, three-person one-design
      boats, and development boats. The classes are determined by the International
      Olympic Committee based on IYRU recommendations, and the specific models may
      change from one Olympics to another. Windsurfing was introduced as an Olympic
      event in 1984.
    type: Class Structure and Changes
  - content: The move toward smaller, standardized boats and fewer classes made Olympic
      yacht racing more accessible and competitive, reducing logistical challenges
      and the need for large crews. This shift also encouraged the popularity of one-class
      racing and contributed to the sport's global standardization.

- aspects:
  - content: 'Yacht races are conducted over two main types of courses: point-to-point
      and closed courses. Point-to-point races involve sailing from one location to
      another, often over long distances (e.g., transoceanic races), while closed
      courses are typically triangular or circuit-based, starting and ending at the
      same location.'
    type: Types and Definitions
  - content: Famous point-to-point races include the Bermuda Race and the Transpacific
      Race, both first held in 1906. Closed-course races are common for prestigious
      events such as the America’s Cup. The One Ton Cup incorporates both types. Smaller
      boats, particularly on inland or inshore waters, usually compete on closed,
      triangular courses.
    type: Examples and Applications
  - content: The type of course significantly affects race strategy, boat design,
      and crew skills. Point-to-point races often require navigation and endurance,
      while closed courses emphasize tactical maneuvering and speed around marks.
      The diversity of course types reflects the adaptability and complexity of yacht
      racing as a sport.
    type: Implications and Strategy
