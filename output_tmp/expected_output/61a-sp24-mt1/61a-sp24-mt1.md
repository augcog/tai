## 3 (8.0 points) Nearly Square

Implement near_square, which takes positive integer n and non-negative integer k. It returns the largest integer less than or equal to n which is the product of two positive integers that differ by k or less. You may use solve, which is provided.

def near_square(n, k):  """Return the largest integer that is less than or equal to n and  equals a * b for some positive integers a and b where abs(a - b) <= k.
