sections:
- aspects:
  - content: The 2026 Formula 1 season introduces a comprehensive overhaul of technical
      regulations, affecting both car chassis and power units. This includes smaller,
      lighter cars, a shift away from ground effect aerodynamics, and the introduction
      of active aerodynamics allowing real-time adjustments to front and rear wings
      based on track position.
    type: Definition
  - content: The power units will retain the 1.6-litre V6 turbocharged configuration
      but will now feature an approximately 50:50 split between internal combustion
      and electrical energy. The MGU-H (Motor Generator Unit-Heat) is removed, simplifying
      the hybrid system, and all cars will run on 100% sustainable fuels, marking
      a significant step towards environmental sustainability.
    type: Power Unit Changes
  - content: Drivers will have increased influence over performance through new energy
      deployment strategies, including creative use of energy recovered under braking
      and a manual override mode that provides a power boost similar to DRS for overtaking.
      These changes are expected to create new strategic layers and potentially shake
      up the competitive order.
    type: Driver Impact and Race Dynamics
  - content: Historically, major regulatory shifts have led to changes in team dominance
      and competitive balance, as seen in 2014. The 2026 changes aim to promote closer
      racing, sustainability, and technical innovation, while also challenging engineers
      and drivers to adapt to a fundamentally new set of performance parameters.

    explanation: The 2026 regulations introduce active aerodynamics, 100% sustainable
      fuels, a manual override power boost, and remove the MGU-H. The regulations
      call for lighter cars (not increased weight), less reliance on ground effect,
      and maintain the V6 engine with increased electrical energy.
    options:
    - Active aerodynamics and 100% sustainable fuels
    - Increased car weight and enhanced ground effect
    - Manual override power boost and removal of MGU-H
    - Return to V8 engines and reduced electrical energy
