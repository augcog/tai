sections:
- aspects:
  - content: A modem, short for modulator/demodulator, is an electronic device that
      converts digital data signals into modulated analog signals suitable for transmission
      over analog telecommunications circuits, and vice versa. This dual function
      enables digital devices to communicate over traditional analog infrastructures,
      such as telephone lines.
    type: definition
  - content: Common examples of modem use include enabling email communication between
      personal computers, transmitting faxes between fax machines, and downloading
      multimedia files from web servers to home computers. Modems are available as
      external modules, internal circuit boards, or card-sized units for laptops,
      and include both voiceband and cable modem types.
    type: examples
  - content: The modem's ability to bridge digital and analog worlds made possible
      the widespread adoption of computer networking and internet access over existing
      telephone and cable networks. This compatibility with established telecommunications
      media was crucial in the early growth of digital communication.
    type: implications
  - content: Modems are closely related to concepts such as data transmission, telecommunications
      media, and peripheral devices. They are foundational to the development of the
      internet, facilitating the transition from analog to digital communication systems.

    explanation: A modem's main function is to convert digital data signals into modulated
      analog signals for transmission over analog circuits, and to reverse the process,
      enabling communication between digital devices over analog infrastructure.
    options:
    - Amplifying analog voice signals for long-distance calls
    - Converting digital data signals to modulated analog signals and vice versa
    - Storing large volumes of digital data for network backup
    - Transmitting only video signals over fiber optic cables
    question_text: Which of the following best describes the primary function of a
      modem?
  index: 159
  key_concept: modem
  name: modem
- aspects:
  - content: Operating parameters of modems refer to the technical standards and protocols
      that govern how modems communicate, including signaling, modulation, encoding
      schemes, and transmission speeds. These parameters ensure interoperability and
      reliable data exchange between different modems.
    type: definition
  - content: Examples include the V-series recommendations by the ITU, which specify
      how modems initiate and terminate communication, agree on compatible modulation
      methods, and set transmission speeds. 'Full-duplex' standards allow simultaneous
      two-way communication, while 'half-duplex' standards permit two-way communication
      but not at the same time.
    type: examples
  - content: Standardized operating parameters are essential for global compatibility,
      allowing devices from different manufacturers and regions to interoperate. The
      ability for modems to 'fall back' to lower speeds ensures communication can
      still occur even if one modem is slower or if line quality is poor.
    type: implications
  - content: Operating parameters are linked to broader concepts such as data encoding,
      error correction, and network protocols. They also connect to the evolution
      of modem technology, as advances in modulation and encoding have enabled higher
      data rates and more reliable communication.

- aspects:
  - content: Voiceband modems were developed to enable digital data transmission over
      telephone channels originally designed for human voice, which have a limited
      bandwidth. Their evolution reflects the need to adapt digital communication
      to existing analog infrastructure.
    type: context
  - content: Early voiceband modems, such as those used for telephotography and fax
      transmission in the 1930s, laid the groundwork for later digital modems. By
      the 1950s and 1960s, modems like the Bell 103 and Bell 212 enabled full-duplex
      and higher-speed data transmission over standard telephone lines.
    type: examples
  - content: The development of voiceband modems was integral in extending the reach
      of digital communication to homes and businesses without requiring new infrastructure.
      It enabled the spread of computer networking and internet access before the
      advent of broadband technologies.
    type: implications
  - content: Voiceband modem development is connected to advances in modulation techniques,
      equalization methods, and the broader history of telecommunications. It also
      set the stage for later technologies such as DSL and cable modems.
