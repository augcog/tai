sections:
- aspects:
  - content: Virtual reality (VR) is the use of computer modeling and simulation to
      enable a person to interact with an artificial three-dimensional (3-D) environment.
      The experience is typically immersive, relying on interactive devices such as
      goggles, headsets, gloves, or body suits that both send and receive information,
      creating the illusion of presence within a simulated world. The term 'virtual
      reality' was coined by Jaron Lanier in 1987, marking the formalization of the
      field.
    type: definition
  - content: Examples of VR technology include head-mounted displays that present
      stereoscopic images, data gloves with force-feedback for tactile interaction,
      and motion sensors that track user movements to adjust the virtual environment
      in real time. Users can manipulate virtual objects, navigate simulated spaces,
      and experience sensations such as touch, all generated by computer systems.
    type: examples
  - content: VR enables new forms of interaction and simulation, allowing users to
      experience environments and scenarios otherwise inaccessible or impossible in
      the real world. It has significant implications for fields such as training,
      education, entertainment, and therapy, as well as raising questions about the
      nature of reality, perception, and the psychological effects of immersion.
    type: implications
  - content: VR is closely related to fields such as computer graphics, simulation,
      haptic technology, and telepresence. It is distinct from but related to augmented
      reality, which overlays virtual elements onto the real world rather than creating
      a fully immersive artificial environment.

    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: Virtual reality is defined as a computer-generated immersive environment
      experienced through interactive devices such as headsets and gloves. It is not
      simply data storage, computational speed, or augmented reality (which overlays
      information onto the real world).
    options:
    - A technology for overlaying digital information onto the real world.
    - A computer-generated immersive environment experienced through interactive devices.
    - A method for storing and retrieving large amounts of data.
    - A technique for enhancing the speed of computer calculations.
    question_text: Which of the following best describes virtual reality as defined
      in the article?
  index: 160
  key_concept: virtual reality definition and technology
  name: virtual reality
- aspects:
  - content: Long before the advent of computer-based VR, artists and entertainers
      sought to create immersive, illusionary spaces that stimulated the senses and
      suspended disbelief. These efforts provided important conceptual precedents
      for modern virtual reality.
    type: context
  - content: Historical examples include panoramic paintings of the 18th and 19th
      centuries, which used large curved surfaces and visual tricks to create a sense
      of immersion. Later, technologies such as stereopticons, 3-D movies, and IMAX
      theaters were developed to enhance the viewer's sense of presence and depth
      in artistic and entertainment contexts.
    type: examples
  - content: These artistic traditions demonstrated the psychological power of immersion
      and influenced the design goals of later VR systems. The desire to blur the
      boundaries between observer and scene set the stage for technological attempts
      to simulate reality more convincingly.
    type: implications
  - content: The progression from painted panoramas to immersive cinema reflects a
      continuous pursuit of greater realism and sensory engagement, directly informing
      the conceptual and technical development of VR technologies.

- aspects:
  - content: The Sensorama Simulator, created by Morton Heilig in the early 1960s,
      was an individual console designed to stimulate multiple senses—sight, sound,
      touch, smell, and motion—to realistically simulate an experience. It is considered
      an early attempt at creating a multisensory virtual environment.
    type: definition
  - content: The Sensorama included stereoscopic images, a motion chair, audio, temperature
      changes, odors, and blown air. Heilig also designed the Telesphere Mask, a head-mounted
      stereoscopic 3-D TV display, and later proposed multiviewer theaters and systems
      for companies like Disney.
    type: examples
  - content: Heilig's work demonstrated the importance of multisensory integration
      for creating convincing virtual experiences and anticipated many features of
      modern VR systems. Although not commercially successful, these inventions established
      foundational concepts for future development.
    type: implications
  - content: The Sensorama and related devices bridged the gap between artistic immersion
      and technological simulation, influencing subsequent innovations in VR hardware
      and interface design.
