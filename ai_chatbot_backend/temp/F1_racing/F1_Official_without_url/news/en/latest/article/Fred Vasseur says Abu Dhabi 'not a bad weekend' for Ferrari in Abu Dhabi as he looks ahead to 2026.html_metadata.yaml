      challenges, and outcomes throughout the Formula 1 season. It includes race results,
      championship standings, and notable events impacting the team's trajectory.
    type: Definition
  - content: Ferrari failed to secure a single Grand Prix victory in 2025 and finished

      winning the Constructors' title.
    type: Examples
  - content: The lack of wins and the large points gap to the champions highlight
      areas requiring improvement, such as car development, strategy, and consistency.

  name: Vasseur says Abu Dhabi 'not a bad weekend' for Ferrari in Abu Dhabi as he
    looks ahead to 2026
- aspects:
  - content: Anticipation for the 2026 regulation changes refers to the expectations
      and preparations surrounding a major overhaul of Formula 1's technical and sporting
      rules, set to take effect in the 2026 season. These changes are expected to
      significantly alter the competitive landscape.
    type: Definition
  - content: Fred Vasseur emphasized that the upcoming regulation changes could result
      in a new pecking order among teams, making it difficult to predict which teams
      will be competitive. Teams are preparing by focusing on internal development
      and maximizing performance before the new rules are implemented.
    type: Examples
  - content: The regulation changes create uncertainty and opportunity; teams that
      interpret the new rules most effectively could gain a significant advantage.
      For Ferrari, this represents a chance to reset and potentially close the gap
      to rivals, but also a risk if their preparations fall short.
    type: Implications
  - content: Such regulation overhauls have historically led to shifts in competitive
      balance, as seen with previous changes in 2014 (hybrid era) and 2022 (aerodynamic
      changes). Teams often use the season prior to a major change to experiment and
      gather data for future development.
