sections:
- aspects:
  - content: Pirelli, the official tyre supplier for Formula 1, selects specific tyre
      compounds for each Grand Prix based on the circuit's characteristics and expected
      conditions. For the 2025 Qatar Grand Prix at Lusail International Circuit, Pirelli
      has chosen the C1 (hard), C2 (medium), and C3 (soft) compounds. These compounds
      are part of a standardized range, with C1 being the hardest and C5 the softest,
      designed to balance durability and grip.
    type: Definition
  - content: The C1 compound is marked with a white sidewall and is the hardest available,
      providing maximum durability but less grip. The C2, marked yellow, offers a
      compromise between durability and performance, while the C3, marked red, is
      the softest for this event, offering the most grip but wearing out faster. These
      selections are tailored to the Lusail circuit, which features high-speed corners
      and aggressive kerbs.
    type: Examples
  - content: The choice of compounds affects race strategy, as teams must balance
      tyre longevity with performance. Harder tyres may last longer but offer less
      peak performance, while softer tyres provide speed at the cost of rapid degradation.
      The selection also reflects Pirelli's response to the circuit's history of high
      tyre wear and thermal stress, aiming to ensure safety and competitive racing.
    type: Implications
  - content: Tyre compound selection is closely linked to other regulatory measures,
      such as the maximum lap limit per set and the allocation for Sprint weekends.
      It is also influenced by data from previous races, including wear patterns and
      structural integrity observed in past events, particularly in challenging circuits
      like Qatar.

    explanation: Pirelli has officially selected the C1 as the hard, C2 as the medium,
      and C3 as the soft compound for the 2025 Qatar Grand Prix, reflecting the need
      for durability and grip on the demanding Lusail circuit.
    options:
    - C1 (hard), C2 (medium), C3 (soft)
    - C2 (hard), C3 (medium), C4 (soft)
    - C3 (hard), C4 (medium), C5 (soft)
    - C1 (soft), C2 (medium), C5 (hard)

  key_concept: Pirelli Tyre Compound Selection
  name: What tyres will the teams and drivers have for the 2025 Qatar Grand Prix?
- aspects:
  - content: During Sprint weekends, Formula 1 modifies the standard tyre allocation
      to accommodate the additional competitive session. For the 2025 Qatar Grand
      Prix, which uses the Sprint format, each driver receives 12 sets of dry tyres
      instead of the usual 13.
    type: Definition
  - content: The allocation for Qatar includes two sets of the hard (C1, white), four
      sets of the medium (C2, yellow), and six sets of the soft (C3, red) tyres. Additionally,
      drivers have access to green-marked intermediate tyres and blue-marked full
      wet tyres in case of rain.
    type: Examples
  - content: Teams must strategically plan tyre usage across practice, qualifying,
      the Sprint, and the Grand Prix. The reduced allocation increases the importance
      of tyre management, especially given the high wear expected at Lusail and the
      mandatory lap limits.
    type: Use Cases
  - content: The limited number of sets requires teams to optimize their running in
      each session, balancing the need for data collection with tyre preservation.
      It also impacts pit stop strategy and could influence the outcome of both the
      Sprint and main race.
    type: Implications
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 2
    explanation: For Sprint weekends such as the 2025 Qatar Grand Prix, drivers are
      allocated 12 sets of dry tyres, which is one fewer than the standard allocation
      for non-Sprint events.
    options:
    - 13 sets
    - 10 sets
    - 12 sets
    - 15 sets

      Qatar Grand Prix Sprint weekend?
  index: 53
  key_concept: Sprint Weekend Tyre Allocation
  name: What tyres will the teams and drivers have for the 2025 Qatar Grand Prix?
- aspects:
  - content: A maximum tyre usage limit is a regulatory measure that restricts the
      total number of laps a single set of tyres can be used during the race weekend.
      For the 2025 Qatar Grand Prix, Pirelli and the FIA have set a 25-lap maximum
      per set, counted cumulatively across all sessions.
    type: Definition
  - content: This rule was introduced after analysis of tyre wear during the 2024
      Qatar Grand Prix, where tyres—especially the left front—showed extreme wear
      and structural fatigue due to the circuit's high lateral energy and harsh kerbs.
      The measure is intended to enhance safety and prevent failures.
    type: Context
  - content: If a driver uses a set of tyres for 10 laps in practice, only 15 laps
      remain for that set for the rest of the weekend. Laps under Safety Car or Virtual
      Safety Car count toward the limit, but laps to the grid, formation laps, and
      post-chequered flag laps do not.
    type: Examples
  - content: This limit ensures that no set is overstressed, mandating at least two
      pit stops during the 57-lap race. Teams must carefully monitor and manage tyre
      usage, with Pirelli informing teams before the race how many laps remain for
      each set.
    type: Implications
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: Pirelli has mandated a 25-lap maximum per set for the 2025 Qatar
      Grand Prix, aiming to prevent excessive wear and ensure safety after issues
      observed in 2024.
    options:
    - 20 laps
    - 25 laps
    - 30 laps
    - No limit

      used during the 2025 Qatar Grand Prix weekend?
  index: 53
  key_concept: Maximum Tyre Usage Limit
  name: What tyres will the teams and drivers have for the 2025 Qatar Grand Prix?
- aspects:
  - content: The rationale for imposing strict tyre usage limits at the 2025 Qatar
      Grand Prix stems from data collected during the 2024 event, where tyres experienced
      high wear, particularly on the left front. The Lusail circuit's combination
      of high-speed corners and aggressive kerbs places extreme stress on tyres.
    type: Context
  - content: Without these restrictions, tyres could reach dangerous levels of wear,
      risking structural failure and compromising driver safety. The 25-lap limit
      is a proactive measure to ensure that tyres are not used beyond their safe operating
      window.
    type: Implications
  - content: This decision was made collaboratively by Pirelli, the FIA, and Formula
      1, and was communicated to teams in advance. It reflects an ongoing process
      of safety management and technical adaptation based on real-world data and post-race
      analysis.
    type: Connections
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: The maximum lap limit was introduced due to excessive tyre wear and
      signs of structural fatigue observed during the 2024 Qatar Grand Prix, especially
      on the left front tyre, to enhance safety.
    options:
    - To reduce pit stops and make the race faster
    - Because tyres showed excessive wear and potential structural fatigue in 2024
    - To allow teams to use softer compounds more frequently
    - To simplify tyre strategy for teams
