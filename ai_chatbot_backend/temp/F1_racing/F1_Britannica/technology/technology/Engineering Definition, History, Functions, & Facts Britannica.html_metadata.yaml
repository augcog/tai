sections:
- aspects:
  - content: Engineering is the application of scientific principles to the optimal
      conversion of natural resources for human use. It is defined as the creative
      application of science to design, develop, construct, operate, and forecast
      the behavior of structures, machines, apparatus, or processes, with due regard
      to function, economics, and safety. The field encompasses a vast body of specialized
      knowledge and requires extensive training for professional practice.
    type: Definition
  - content: Examples of engineering activities include designing bridges, developing
      manufacturing processes, constructing water supply systems, and operating power
      plants. In Great Britain, the term can also refer more broadly to the manufacture
      or assembly of engines and machine parts.
    type: Examples
  - content: Engineers must balance conflicting requirements such as efficiency, cost,
      safety, and performance, often under constraints of limited resources. The solutions
      they devise are considered optimal when they best satisfy these competing demands.
      Their work has significant social and environmental impacts, requiring ethical
      responsibility to the public.
    type: Implications
  - content: Engineering is closely linked to science, particularly physics, chemistry,
      and mathematics, but differs in its focus on practical problem-solving. While
      scientists seek to expand knowledge, engineers apply that knowledge to real-world
      challenges. The profession is regulated through standards and professional societies
      to ensure public safety and ethical practice.

    explanation: Engineering is primarily concerned with the creative application
      of scientific principles to solve practical problems, not just theoretical exploration
      or manufacturing engines.
    options:
    - Theoretical exploration of natural phenomena
    - Creative application of scientific principles to solve practical problems
    - Manufacturing only engines and machine parts
    - Developing philosophical theories about technology
    question_text: Which of the following best describes the primary focus of engineering?

  key_concept: Definition and Scope of Engineering
  name: engineering
- aspects:
  - content: The first known engineer was Imhotep, builder of the Step Pyramid in
      ancient Egypt around 2550 BCE. Early engineers in Egypt, Persia, Greece, and
      Rome achieved remarkable feats in civil engineering, such as aqueducts, temples,
      and road systems, using empirical methods and basic scientific knowledge.
    type: Early History
  - content: Medieval European engineers advanced construction techniques with innovations
      like the Gothic arch and flying buttress. In Asia, independent but parallel
      developments in hydraulics, metallurgy, and city planning led to sophisticated
      civilizations, as seen in the Mongol empire's impressive cities.
    type: Medieval and Asian Contributions
  - content: Civil engineering became a distinct discipline in the 18th century with
      the founding of professional societies and schools. The 19th century saw the
      rise of mechanical engineering, driven by industrial advances and inventions
      such as James Watt’s steam engine.
    type: Emergence of Disciplines
  - content: The 19th and 20th centuries brought about electrical, electronics, and
      chemical engineering as new fields, spurred by discoveries in electricity and
      industrial chemistry. The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw the growth
      of environmental engineering, focusing on sustainability, renewable energy,
      and pollution control.
    type: Modern Expansion
  - content: Engineering’s historical evolution reflects society’s changing needs
