sections:
- aspects:
  - content: A head-mounted display (HMD) is a device worn on the head or as part
      of a helmet that places a small display optic in front of one or both eyes.
      HMDs are designed to provide visual information directly to the user, often
      immersing them in a virtual or augmented environment. The display can be monocular
      (one eye) or binocular (both eyes), and may include sensors to track head movements.
    type: Definition
  - content: Early examples of HMDs include Ivan Sutherland's 1967 device, sometimes
      called the 'Sword of Damocles,' which was one of the first systems to use computer-generated
      imagery in a head-worn format. Modern HMDs are found in virtual reality headsets
      like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, as well as augmented reality devices such
      as Microsoft HoloLens.
    type: Examples
  - content: HMDs are used in a variety of fields, including aviation (for pilot situational
      awareness), military (for targeting and navigation), medicine (for surgery assistance),
      and entertainment (for immersive gaming and simulations). In industrial contexts,
      HMDs can overlay technical data onto the user's field of view for maintenance
      or assembly tasks.
    type: Use Cases
  - content: The adoption of HMDs has significant implications for how users interact
      with digital information, enabling hands-free and context-aware experiences.
      HMDs are central to the development of virtual and augmented reality, bridging
      the gap between the physical and digital worlds. They are also linked to advances
      in sensor technology, computer vision, and ergonomics.

    explanation: A head-mounted display is specifically a wearable device that positions
      a display in front of the user's eyes, unlike handheld devices, desktop monitors,
      or wall projectors.
    options:
    - A handheld device for displaying virtual images
    - A wearable device that presents visual information directly to the user's eyes
    - A desktop monitor used for computer graphics
    - A projector that displays images on a wall
    question_text: Which of the following best describes a head-mounted display (HMD)?
  index: 122
  key_concept: head-mounted display
  name: head-mounted display
- aspects:
  - content: The development of virtual-reality technology has been closely tied to
      advancements in head-mounted displays. Early work in the field included experiments
      with HMDs to enhance user immersion and interaction with simulated environments.
      Notably, in the late 1960s and 1970s, researchers explored the use of HMDs for
      both entertainment and practical applications such as flight simulation.
    type: Historical Context
  - content: A significant milestone in the development of VR technology was the use
      of an HMD by a helicopter pilot, which displayed video from a servo-controlled
      infrared camera mounted beneath the helicopter. The camera's movement was synchronized
      with the pilot's head, allowing the pilot's field of vision to match the camera's
      perspective, thus augmenting night vision and enhancing situational awareness.
    type: Key Example
  - content: This integration of HMDs in aviation demonstrated the potential for immersive
      technology to improve safety, situational awareness, and operational effectiveness.
      It also set the stage for the adoption of VR in training, simulation, and entertainment,
      where immersion and real-time interaction are critical.
    type: Implications and Use Cases
  - content: The development of VR technology with HMDs is interconnected with advancements
      in camera systems, motion tracking, and computer graphics. These technologies
      collectively enable the creation of convincing virtual environments and responsive
      user experiences.
