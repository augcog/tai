sections:
- aspects:
  - content: A gun-assembly fission bomb is a type of nuclear weapon that operates
      by rapidly bringing together two or more subcritical masses of fissile material,
      such as uranium-235, to form a supercritical mass capable of sustaining a nuclear
      chain reaction. The device uses a conventional explosive to propel one piece
      of fissile material into another, mimicking the action of a gun, hence the name.
      This method is considered the simplest design for a fission bomb, as it relies
      on straightforward mechanical assembly rather than complex compression techniques.
    type: definition
  - content: The most famous example of a gun-assembly fission bomb is 'Little Boy,'
      the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. In this device, a projectile of
      uranium-235 was fired into a target of the same material, rapidly achieving
      a supercritical mass and initiating a nuclear explosion. This design was chosen
      for its reliability and simplicity, despite being less efficient than more advanced
      designs.
    type: example
  - content: Gun-assembly fission bombs are primarily used as weapons of mass destruction
      due to their immense explosive power. Their straightforward design made them
      suitable for early nuclear weapons programs, especially when technological resources
      were limited. However, their use has been largely superseded by more sophisticated
      implosion-type designs, which are more efficient and can utilize a wider range
      of fissile materials.
    type: use case
  - content: The simplicity of the gun-assembly mechanism has significant implications
      for nuclear proliferation, as it lowers the technical barrier for constructing
      a functional nuclear weapon if sufficient fissile material is available. However,
      this design is generally limited to uranium-235 due to the risk of predetonation
      with plutonium-239, making material acquisition a critical challenge.
    type: implication
  - content: The gun-assembly fission bomb is connected to the broader category of
      fission bombs, which also includes implosion-type devices. Understanding the
      gun-assembly method provides foundational knowledge for studying the evolution
      of nuclear weapons technology and the physics of nuclear chain reactions.

    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: The gun-assembly fission bomb works by using an explosive propellant
      to fire one subcritical mass into another, rapidly forming a supercritical mass
      and initiating a nuclear chain reaction. It does not rely on compression (implosion),
      chemical reactions, or electromagnetic assembly.
    options:
    - It uses conventional explosives to compress a subcritical mass into a supercritical
      state.
    - It rapidly combines two subcritical masses of fissile material using an explosive
      propellant.
    - It relies on chemical reactions to generate high temperatures for fusion.
    - It uses electromagnetic forces to assemble fissile material.
    question_text: Which statement best describes the operational principle of a gun-assembly
      fission bomb?
  index: 122
  key_concept: gun-assembly fission bomb
  name: gun-assembly fission bomb
- aspects:
  - content: Fission bombs are nuclear weapons that derive their explosive energy
      from the rapid splitting (fission) of heavy atomic nuclei, such as uranium-235
      or plutonium-239. When a critical mass of fissile material is assembled, a chain
      reaction occurs, releasing vast amounts of energy in the form of heat, light,
      and radiation.
    type: definition
  - content: Examples of fission bombs include both the gun-assembly design ('Little
      Boy') and the implosion design ('Fat Man,' which used plutonium-239 and a spherical
      compression mechanism). Both types were used during World War II, demonstrating
      the destructive potential of nuclear fission.
    type: example
  - content: Fission bombs have been used in warfare (notably in Hiroshima and Nagasaki)
      and serve as the primary stage in most thermonuclear weapons. They are also
      central to discussions on nuclear deterrence, arms control, and non-proliferation.
    type: use case
  - content: The development and use of fission bombs have had profound implications
      for international security, ethics, and policy. Their existence has shaped global
      politics, led to the creation of international treaties, and raised ongoing
      concerns about proliferation and the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons.
    type: implication
  - content: Fission bombs are foundational to the understanding of nuclear weapon
      technology and are directly related to other nuclear devices, such as fusion
      (thermonuclear) bombs, which use a fission bomb as a trigger for a secondary
      fusion reaction.

  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 2
    explanation: Gun-assembly devices use an explosive propellant to bring together
      two subcritical masses, while implosion devices use explosives to compress a
      single subcritical mass into a supercritical configuration. Both are fission-based,
      but their assembly mechanisms differ.
    options:
    - Gun-assembly devices use fusion reactions, while implosion devices use fission.
    - Gun-assembly devices compress fissile material, while implosion devices combine
      two subcritical masses.
    - Gun-assembly devices rapidly combine subcritical masses using a propellant,
      while implosion devices use explosives to compress a subcritical mass into a
      supercritical state.
    - Gun-assembly devices are only theoretical, while implosion devices have been
      used in warfare.
