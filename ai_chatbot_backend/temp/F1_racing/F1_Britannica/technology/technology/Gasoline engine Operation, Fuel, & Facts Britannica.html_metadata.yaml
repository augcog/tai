sections:
- aspects:
  - content: A gasoline engine is a type of internal-combustion engine that generates
      power by burning a volatile liquid fuel, typically gasoline or a gasoline-ethanol
      mixture, with ignition initiated by an electric spark. The process converts
      chemical energy from the fuel into mechanical work.
    type: Definition
  - content: Gasoline engines are highly versatile and used in a wide range of applications.
      The most significant use is in passenger automobiles, but they are also common
      in small trucks, buses, general aviation aircraft, outboard and small inboard
      marine units, stationary pumping and lighting plants, machine tools, and power
      tools. Their adaptability to different power-plant requirements is a key feature.
    type: Applications
  - content: These engines require a volatile liquid fuel, most commonly gasoline,
      but sometimes gasoline-ethanol blends. Ignition is achieved via an electric
      spark, distinguishing gasoline engines from diesel engines, which use compression
      ignition. The volatility of the fuel allows for efficient mixing with air and
      rapid combustion.
    type: Fuel and Ignition
  - content: Four-stroke gasoline engines dominate the automotive sector, powering
      most cars, light trucks, motorcycles, and lawn mowers. Two-stroke gasoline engines
      are less common but are preferred for small outboard marine engines and handheld
      tools like chainsaws and leaf blowers, where simplicity and power-to-weight
      ratio are critical.
    type: Prevalence and Variants
  - content: The gasoline engine's reliance on spark ignition and volatile fuels shapes
      its performance characteristics, emissions, and environmental impact. Its widespread
      use has driven technological advances in fuel efficiency, emissions control,
      and alternative fuels, while also raising concerns about fossil fuel dependence
      and air pollution.
    type: Connections and Implications

    correct_answer:
    - 0
    explanation: Gasoline engines are defined by their use of spark ignition and volatile
      liquid fuels like gasoline. They are widely used in automobiles, small trucks,
      marine, and aviation applications. Diesel engines use compression ignition,
      and gasoline engines are not limited to large-scale power plants.
    options:
    - It is an internal-combustion engine that uses spark ignition and volatile liquid
      fuels.
    - It relies solely on compression ignition and diesel fuel.
    - It is mainly used in large-scale power plants and heavy industry.
    - It cannot be used in marine or aviation applications.
    question_text: Which of the following statements accurately describes a gasoline
      engine?
  index: 181
  key_concept: gasoline engine
  name: gasoline engine
- aspects:
  - content: Gasoline engines are classified based on several criteria, including
      application (e.g., automotive, marine, aviation), method of fuel management
      (carbureted or fuel-injected), ignition method (spark or compression), piston-and-cylinder
      or rotary arrangement, number of strokes per cycle (two-stroke or four-stroke),
      cooling system (air or liquid-cooled), and valve type/location.
    type: Classification Criteria
  - content: The two principal types of gasoline engines are piston-and-cylinder engines
      and rotary (Wankel) engines. Piston-and-cylinder engines use reciprocating pistons
      to convert combustion pressure into motion, while rotary engines use a rotating
      rotor to achieve the same result without conventional pistons.
    type: Major Types
  - content: Common configurations include in-line engines, V-type engines (such as
      V-8s), opposed-piston engines, and Wankel rotary engines. Each configuration
      has specific advantages in terms of balance, compactness, and application suitability.
    type: Examples
  - content: The choice of engine type affects performance, efficiency, maintenance,
      and suitability for different vehicles or tools. For instance, rotary engines
      are valued for their compactness and smooth operation, while piston engines
      are favored for reliability and widespread support.
    type: Implications and Use Cases
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: Engine types are classified by functional and design criteria such
      as number of strokes, ignition method, and whether they use pistons or rotors.
      The color of the engine block is not a relevant classification criterion.
    options:
    - Number of strokes per cycle
    - Color of the engine block
    - Ignition method
    - Piston-and-cylinder or rotary arrangement
    question_text: Which of the following is NOT a major criterion for classifying
      gasoline engine types?
  index: 304
  key_concept: Engine types
  name: Engine types
- aspects:
  - content: Piston-and-cylinder engines are reciprocating internal-combustion engines
      in which the combustion of fuel creates pressure on the piston head, causing
      it to move back and forth (reciprocate) within a cylinder. This motion is converted
      into rotational motion to perform mechanical work.
    type: Definition and Structure
  - content: Key components include the piston, cylinder, crankshaft, connecting rod,
      valves, and sometimes a camshaft. The arrangement allows for the intake of air-fuel
      mixture, compression, combustion, and exhaust in a controlled sequence.
    type: Components
  - content: Most gasoline engines in vehicles and small machinery are of the piston-and-cylinder
      type. Their design allows for scalability from small handheld devices to large
      automotive engines.
    type: Prevalence
  - content: These engines typically operate on either a four-stroke or two-stroke
      cycle, determining how the intake, compression, power, and exhaust processes
      are sequenced. The four-stroke cycle is most common in automobiles, while the
      two-stroke cycle is used in smaller, lighter applications.
    type: Operating Cycles
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: The piston moves back and forth within the cylinder, converting the
      pressure from combustion into mechanical motion. It does not store electricity,
      inject fuel, or serve as a cooling device.
    options:
    - To store electrical energy
    - To reciprocate within the cylinder and convert combustion pressure into motion
    - To act as a fuel injector
    - To cool the engine block
    question_text: What is the primary function of the piston in a piston-and-cylinder
      gasoline engine?
  index: 312
  key_concept: Piston-and-cylinder engines
  name: '[Piston-and-cylinder](https://www.britannica.com/technology/piston-and-cylinder
    "https://www.britannica.com/technology/piston-and-cylinder") engines'
- aspects:
  - content: 'The four-stroke cycle, developed in the late 19th century, is a method
      for recovering power from combustion in internal-combustion engines. It consists
      of four sequential piston movements (strokes): intake, compression, power (combustion),
      and exhaust.'
    type: Definition and History
  - content: During the intake stroke, the piston descends and draws in a mixture
      of air and gasoline vapor. The compression stroke follows, with both valves
      closed, compressing the mixture as the piston ascends. Near the top of this
      stroke, an electric spark ignites the mixture, causing rapid combustion and
      a power stroke that forces the piston downward. The exhaust stroke then expels
      combustion products as the piston rises again with the exhaust valve open.
    type: Operation Sequence
  - content: Each complete cycle requires four piston strokes and two revolutions
      of the crankshaft. The timing of valve openings and spark ignition is critical
      for efficient operation and is controlled by the engine's camshaft and ignition
      system.
    type: Mechanical Details
  - content: The four-stroke cycle provides thorough scavenging (clearing out exhaust
      gases) and reloading of the cylinder, reducing loss of fresh charge and improving
      efficiency. However, it delivers only half as many power strokes per revolution
      as a two-stroke cycle, meaning less power output for a given engine size and
      speed.
    type: Advantages and Disadvantages
  - content: The four-stroke cycle is the dominant operating principle in automotive
      engines, as well as in motorcycles, lawn mowers, and many other machines where
      efficiency and emissions control are important. It is less common in small,
      lightweight tools, where two-stroke engines may be preferred.
    type: Examples and Applications
