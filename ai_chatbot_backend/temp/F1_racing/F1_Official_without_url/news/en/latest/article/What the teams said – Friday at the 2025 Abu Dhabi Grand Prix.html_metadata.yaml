- aspects:
  - content: This concept covers Pirelli’s technical analysis of tyre performance
      during Friday practice, including degradation patterns, compound suitability,
      and implications for race strategy at Yas Marina.
    type: Definition and Overview
  - content: Pirelli observed that lap times were about half a second faster than
      the previous year, but graining—especially on the front-right tyre—was accelerating
      degradation. Medium and hard compounds showed the most consistency for race
      conditions, while the soft was best for qualifying laps.
    type: Tyre Performance and Graining
  - content: Track evolution, due to rubber being laid down by support races, was
      expected to reduce graining as the weekend progressed. This could bring the
      soft C5 tyre back into play for the race, depending on how grip levels change.
    type: Track Evolution and Strategy Considerations
  - content: Teams like McLaren and Aston Martin saved a set of hard tyres in FP2,
      anticipating strategic flexibility. The performance gap between compounds (about
      two tenths between hard and medium, and seven to eight tenths between medium
      and soft) influences pit stop and stint length decisions.
    type: Examples and Practical Implications
  - content: Pirelli’s analysis informs all teams’ race strategies and highlights
      the dynamic relationship between tyre management, track conditions, and competitive
      decision-making in F1. Their data-driven insights are crucial for predicting
      race outcomes and optimizing performance.
    type: Connections and Broader Context
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 0
    explanation: Pirelli identified the medium and hard as the most consistent for
      race conditions, but noted that as the track evolves and graining decreases,
      the soft C5 could become more viable for race stints.
    options:
    - Medium and hard; due to reduced graining as rubber builds up
    - Soft and medium; because of lower initial degradation
    - Hard only; because it is the fastest compound
    - Soft only; because qualifying pace is most important
    question_text: According to Pirelli, which tyre compounds were most consistent
      for race conditions in Abu Dhabi, and why might the soft C5 become more viable
      as the weekend progresses?
