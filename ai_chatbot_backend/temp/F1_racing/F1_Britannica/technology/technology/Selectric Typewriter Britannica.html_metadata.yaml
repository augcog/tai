sections:
- aspects:
  - content: The Selectric Typewriter was an innovative typewriting machine developed
      and produced by IBM. It was notable for its high-speed, automatic operation
      and introduced significant mechanical and electronic advancements over traditional
      typewriters. Its most distinctive feature was the use of a rotating typeball
      instead of individual typebars, which allowed for faster and more reliable typing.
    type: Definition
  - content: A key technological advancement of the Selectric Typewriter was its magnetic
      tape data-storage unit and retrieval device. This allowed typed information
      to be stored, retrieved, and edited, bridging the gap between mechanical typewriting
      and electronic data processing. The Selectric’s design also enabled greater
      flexibility in changing fonts and characters, which was not possible with earlier
      typewriters.
