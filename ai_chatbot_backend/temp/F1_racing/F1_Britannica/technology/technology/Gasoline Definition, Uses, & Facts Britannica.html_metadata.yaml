- aspects:
  - content: Gasoline is a mixture of volatile, flammable liquid hydrocarbons derived
      from petroleum, primarily used as fuel for internal-combustion engines. It is
      also utilized as a solvent for oils and fats. Originally, gasoline was a by-product
      of the petroleum industry, with kerosene being the main product, but its high
      energy of combustion and ability to mix well with air in carburetors made it
      the preferred automotive fuel.
    type: Definition
  - content: Gasoline is most commonly used in automobiles, motorcycles, and small
      engines such as lawnmowers, generators, and chainsaws. It is also used in aviation
      as aviation gasoline, with a different composition tailored for aircraft engines.
      As a solvent, gasoline is employed in cleaning and degreasing applications in
      industrial settings.
    type: Examples and Applications
  - content: The widespread use of gasoline has significant economic, environmental,
      and technological implications. It has driven the development of the automotive
      industry and modern transportation infrastructure. However, its combustion releases
      pollutants and greenhouse gases, contributing to air quality issues and climate
      change. The shift from being a by-product to a primary product highlights changes
      in industrial priorities and technological advancement.

  key_concept: Definition and Uses of Gasoline
  name: gasoline
- aspects:
  - content: Gasoline production involves separating and converting crude oil components
      through various refining processes. Initially, simple distillation was used
      to separate volatile fractions, but modern methods focus on maximizing gasoline
      yield and quality through chemical transformations.
    type: Definition and Overview
  - content: Major processes include distillation, cracking (thermal and catalytic),
      polymerization, alkylation, isomerization, and reforming. Cracking breaks large
      hydrocarbon molecules into smaller, more volatile ones suitable for gasoline.
      Catalytic cracking, introduced after 1937, uses catalysts to increase efficiency
      and yield. Polymerization combines smaller molecules like olefins into larger
      gasoline-range molecules. Alkylation merges olefins and paraffins, while isomerization
      rearranges straight-chain hydrocarbons into branched forms. Reforming alters
      molecular structures using heat or catalysts to improve fuel quality.
    type: Key Processes
  - content: Thermal cracking was introduced in 1913 but largely replaced by catalytic
      cracking for higher efficiency and better gasoline quality. Alkylation and isomerization
      are especially important for producing high-octane fuels. These processes are
      integral to modern petroleum refineries and are continually optimized to meet
      regulatory standards and market demands.
    type: Examples and Context
  - content: Refining processes not only increase gasoline supply but also enhance
      its performance characteristics, such as volatility and antiknock properties.
      The evolution of these processes reflects advances in chemical engineering and
      the growing demand for efficient, cleaner-burning fuels. Connections exist with
      environmental regulations, as refining methods must adapt to reduce harmful
      emissions and accommodate alternative fuel components.

  key_concept: Production and Refining Processes
  name: gasoline
- aspects:
  - content: Gasoline is a complex mixture of hundreds of different hydrocarbons,
      primarily saturated compounds with 4 to 12 carbon atoms per molecule. The specific
      composition is tailored to achieve desirable physical and chemical properties
      for engine performance.
    type: Definition and Structure
  - content: The boiling range for automobile gasoline is mainly between 30° and 200°
      C (85° and 390° F), with the blend adjusted for seasonal and altitude variations.
      Aviation gasoline differs by containing smaller proportions of both less-volatile
      and more-volatile components to meet the needs of aircraft engines.
    type: Physical Properties
  - content: 'Automobile gasoline must vaporize efficiently under various climatic
      conditions, so its composition is seasonally adjusted: more volatile blends
      for winter and less volatile for summer. Aviation gasoline is formulated to
      prevent vapor lock and ensure consistent performance at high altitudes.'
    type: Examples and Adjustments
  - content: The chemical complexity of gasoline affects its combustion characteristics,
      environmental impact, and compatibility with engine technologies. Adjusting
      the blend for different uses and conditions demonstrates the interplay between
      chemistry, engineering, and environmental considerations. The presence of hundreds
      of hydrocarbons also complicates emission profiles and regulatory compliance.
    type: Implications and Connections

      and why is the blend adjusted?
  index: 130
  key_concept: Chemical Composition and Properties
  name: gasoline
- aspects:
  - content: The antiknock characteristic of gasoline refers to its resistance to
      knocking, a phenomenon where fuel combusts too rapidly in the engine cylinder,
      reducing efficiency and potentially causing damage. This property is quantified
      by the octane number, which measures a fuel's ability to resist knocking.
    type: Definition and Measurement
  - content: Tetraethyllead was historically added to gasoline starting in the 1930s
      to improve its antiknock properties, but its use was discontinued in the 1980s
      due to the toxicity of lead compounds in exhaust emissions. Modern gasoline
      contains other additives, such as detergents to reduce engine deposits, anti-icing
      agents to prevent carburetor icing, and antioxidants to inhibit gum formation.
    type: Historical and Modern Additives
  - content: High-octane fuels are essential for high-performance and aviation engines
      that operate at higher compression ratios. Additives like detergents and anti-icing
      agents are especially important in regions with cold climates or where engines
      are prone to deposit buildup.
    type: Examples and Use Cases
  - content: The shift away from leaded gasoline was driven by public health and environmental
      concerns, leading to the development of unleaded fuels and alternative antiknock
      agents. The use of additives reflects ongoing efforts to improve engine performance,
      reduce maintenance, and comply with environmental regulations. Octane rating
      remains a key parameter in fuel selection and engine design.
    type: Implications and Connections
  check_in_question:

  key_concept: Antiknock Properties and Additives
  name: gasoline
- aspects:
  - content: Alternative fuels, such as gasohol, have been developed to reduce reliance
      on petroleum-based gasoline. Gasohol is a mixture of 90% unleaded gasoline and
      10% ethanol, with ethanol derived from renewable sources like grains, potatoes,
      and other plant matter.
    type: Definition and Types
  - content: Gasohol burns well in standard gasoline engines and has been adopted
      in various countries, especially where ethanol production from crops is economically
      viable. The use of ethanol as a fuel component is common in regions with agricultural
      surpluses or policies promoting renewable energy.
    type: Examples and Applications
  - content: The adoption of alternative fuels like gasohol addresses concerns about
      rising petroleum prices, energy security, and environmental sustainability.
      Ethanol is renewable and can reduce net greenhouse gas emissions, although its
      production and use raise questions about land use, food supply, and overall
      environmental impact.
    type: Implications and Context
  - content: The development and use of alternative fuels are linked to global efforts
      to mitigate climate change, diversify energy sources, and promote sustainable
      agricultural practices. They also influence automotive engineering, fuel infrastructure,
      and regulatory frameworks.
