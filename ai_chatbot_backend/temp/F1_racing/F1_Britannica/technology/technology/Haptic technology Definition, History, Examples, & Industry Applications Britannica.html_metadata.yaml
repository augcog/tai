- aspects:
  - content: Haptic technology refers to systems that simulate the sense of touch
      by applying forces, vibrations, or motions to the user. The term 'haptic' originates
      from the Greek 'haptikós,' meaning 'to touch' or 'to grasp.' Haptic feedback
      is commonly used to enhance user experience in devices such as cell phones,
      game controllers, smartwatches, and cars, as well as in virtual environments.
    type: definition
  - content: Examples of haptic technology include the vibration alert in smartphones,
      force feedback in video game controllers, and tactile sensations in smartwatches.
      In virtual reality, haptic gloves let users feel the texture and resistance
      of virtual objects. Automotive touchscreens with haptic feedback allow drivers
      to interact with controls without diverting their gaze from the road.
    type: examples
  - content: By simulating touch, haptic technology bridges the gap between digital
      and physical experiences, improving usability, safety, and accessibility. It
      connects to fields such as virtual and augmented reality, human-computer interaction,
      and assistive technology for individuals with sensory impairments. The integration
      of haptics is crucial for immersive environments and for enhancing communication

  key_concept: haptic technology
  name: haptic technology
- aspects:
  - content: Haptic technology originated in the 1940s with servomechanisms in aircraft,
      which prevented control stick vibrations and enhanced pilot safety. The realization
      that tactile feedback could warn pilots of dangerous flight conditions led to
      the intentional design of devices that vibrated to signal impending stalls.
      In the 1970s, haptics expanded to accessibility, with patents for tactile telephones
      for the hearing impaired and tactile human-machine interfaces for the visually
      impaired.
    type: historical development
  - content: Key milestones include Thomas D. Shannon's 1973 patent for a tactile
      telephone enabling touch-based communication for the hearing impaired, and A.
      Michael Noll's 1975 patent for a tactile human-machine communication system
      that allowed visually impaired users to feel virtual objects. These advances
      set the stage for broader adoption in consumer and industrial technology.
    type: examples and milestones
  - content: The historical trajectory of haptic technology highlights its dual role
      in safety-critical applications and accessibility. Its evolution reflects a
      growing understanding of the importance of multisensory feedback in human-machine

  key_concept: History
  name: History
- aspects:
  - content: Haptic feedback is primarily generated using mechanical actuators. The
      two most common types are eccentric rotating mass (ERM) actuators, which create
      vibrations by spinning an off-axis mass, and linear resonant actuators (LRAs),
      which use a magnetic mass on a spring moved by electromagnetic induction. Voice
      coil actuators, larger and heavier, provide more realistic vibrations and can
      also mimic auditory effects.
    type: mechanical methods
  - content: Besides vibration, haptic systems can provide kinesthetic feedback (perceiving
      object shape and mass) and button feedback (simulating pressure and sound when
      pressing a touchscreen button). These modes allow for a richer and more varied
      tactile experience.
    type: modes of feedback
  - content: The choice of actuator affects the realism, intensity, and application
      of haptic feedback. ERMs are common in small devices like phones, while LRAs
      and voice coils are used where more nuanced or powerful feedback is needed.
      Edge cases include the need for highly realistic feedback in surgical simulators
      or VR gloves, where fidelity and latency are critical.
