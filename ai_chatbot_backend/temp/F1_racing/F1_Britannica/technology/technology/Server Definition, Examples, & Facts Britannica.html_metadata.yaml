  explanation: In a client-server architecture, the server processes requests from
    clients and responds with the requested resources or services. It does not initiate
    requests to clients.
  knowledge_areas:
  - Client-server architecture
  - Server (computing)
  - Implications and Connections
  options:
  - By sending requests to clients for resources
  - By processing requests from clients and responding with data or services
  - By operating independently without network connections
  - By acting as a backup device only

- aspects:
  - content: A server in computing is a network computer, computer program, or device
      that processes requests from a client. The server's primary function is to provide
      resources, data, or services to other computers, known as clients, over a network.
      Servers can be dedicated hardware or software, and their role is central to
      modern networked environments, including the Internet and local area networks.
    type: Definition
  - content: Common examples of servers include web servers, which use the HTTP protocol
      to deliver web pages to users' browsers upon request; print servers, which manage
      one or more printers and handle print jobs sent from client computers; network
      servers, which manage network traffic and resources; and file servers, which
      store and retrieve files for clients. Each type of server is specialized for
      its particular function within a network.
    type: Examples
  - content: Servers are fundamental to both local and global networks. On the World
      Wide Web, web servers are responsible for hosting websites and serving content
      to users worldwide. In organizational settings, print servers streamline printing
      operations by managing printer access, while file servers centralize data storage
      and sharing. Network servers ensure efficient communication and resource allocation
      across devices. The client-server architecture, in which servers respond to
      client requests, underpins most modern computing environments.
    type: Use Cases and Context
  - content: The concept of a server is closely tied to client-server architecture,
      a foundational model in computer networking. Servers enable scalability, centralized
      management, and resource sharing, but also introduce considerations around security,
      reliability, and maintenance. The proliferation of server types reflects the
      diversity of networked services required in both personal and enterprise computing.
      Understanding servers is essential for grasping how digital information and
      services are delivered and managed.

    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: The primary role of a server is to process requests and provide resources
      or services to client devices. While servers can manage printers or files, their
      essential function is broader than just printing or gaming.
    options:
    - A device that initiates requests to other computers on a network.
    - A computer or program that processes requests and provides resources to clients.
    - A standalone computer used exclusively for gaming.
    - A type of software used only for printing documents.
