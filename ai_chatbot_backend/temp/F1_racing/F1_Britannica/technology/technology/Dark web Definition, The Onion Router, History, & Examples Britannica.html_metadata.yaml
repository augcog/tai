  question_type: recap
sections:
- aspects:
  - content: The dark web refers to websites that are not indexed by standard search
      engines and are accessible only through specialized anonymizing software. It
      is designed to provide users with theoretical anonymity, making it difficult
      to trace their identities or activities. Unlike the surface web, which is indexed
      and accessible via conventional browsers, the dark web is intentionally hidden
      and operates on encrypted networks.
    type: Definition
  - content: The dark web is a subset of the deep web; while the deep web encompasses
      all unindexed content (such as password-protected sites, private databases,
      and subscription services), the dark web specifically refers to encrypted, anonymized
      networks that require special software to access. The deep web is mostly benign,
      including everyday services like email accounts and streaming platforms, whereas
      the dark web is associated with secrecy and sometimes illicit activity.
    type: Distinction from Deep Web
  - content: Examples of deep web content include private email inboxes and paid streaming
      services like Netflix, while dark web content often includes hidden marketplaces,
      forums, and other sites accessible only via networks like Tor. The dark web
      makes up a tiny fraction of the entire web—less than 0.01 percent of the World
      Wide Web.

    question_text: Which of the following accurately distinguishes the dark web from
      the deep web?
  index: 137
  key_concept: Definition and Distinction from Deep Web
  name: dark web
- aspects:
  - content: Anonymizing technologies like The Onion Router (Tor) and Freenet are
      software systems that allow users to access the dark web while concealing their
      identities and online activities. These systems work by encrypting data and
      routing it through multiple nodes in a decentralized network, making it difficult
      to trace the origin and destination of the data.
    type: Definition and Function
  - content: Freenet, developed in 2000 by Ian Clarke, was one of the earliest platforms
      to offer anonymous online communication. Tor, launched in 2002 and developed
      by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, became the most popular anonymizing network.
      To avoid being associated solely with intelligence agencies, Tor was made open
      source in 2004 and is now maintained by the nonprofit Tor Project.
    type: Historical Development
  - content: These technologies are used by privacy advocates, journalists, dissidents
      in oppressive regimes, and others seeking secrecy. However, they also facilitate
      illicit activities by providing a shield for illegal trade, hacking, and the
      distribution of prohibited content. The dual-use nature of these technologies
      fuels debates about their societal value and risks.
    type: Use Cases and Implications
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:

      on the dark web?
  index: 137
  key_concept: Anonymizing Technologies (Tor and Freenet)
  name: dark web
- aspects:
  - content: The modern dark web began with the release of Freenet in 2000, which
      enabled anonymous communication through a decentralized network. The concept
      was further advanced by the introduction of Tor in 2002, which was initially
      developed for secure, anonymous communication by U.S. intelligence agencies.
    type: Origins
  - content: After Tor became open source in 2004, its user base expanded to include
      privacy advocates, journalists, and individuals in repressive countries, as
      well as those seeking to conduct illicit activities. The term 'dark web' first
      appeared in print in 2009, reflecting growing awareness of its criminal uses.
    type: Popularization and Growth
  - content: The rise of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, enabled anonymous online
      transactions, fueling the growth of illegal marketplaces like Silk Road (founded
      in 2011). Law enforcement crackdowns, such as the FBI's arrest of Silk Road's
      founder in 2013, have had only temporary effects, as new marketplaces continue
      to emerge.

  key_concept: History and Evolution of the Dark Web
  name: dark web
- aspects:
  - content: The dark web is known for facilitating illegal trade in controlled substances
      (such as drugs and firearms), stolen data (including credit card and social
      security numbers), and the distribution of illegal pornography. It also serves
      as a platform for hackers, terrorists, and other criminal enterprises to communicate
      and conduct business.
    type: Types of Illicit Activities
  - content: Silk Road, established in 2011, was one of the first and most prominent
      dark web black markets, enabling the anonymous sale of drugs and other illegal
      goods. High-profile data breaches, such as the theft and sale of millions of
      LinkedIn and Yahoo! account passwords, have been traced to dark web marketplaces.
      The Playpen case in 2015 exposed the scale of illegal pornography distribution
      on the dark web, with one site hosting 23,000 sexually explicit images of minors.
    type: Case Studies and Examples
  - content: These activities have made the dark web a focal point for law enforcement
      and policy debates. While the majority of dark web traffic is linked to criminal
      or antisocial behavior, the space is also used for legitimate purposes by those
      requiring anonymity for safety or freedom of expression.
