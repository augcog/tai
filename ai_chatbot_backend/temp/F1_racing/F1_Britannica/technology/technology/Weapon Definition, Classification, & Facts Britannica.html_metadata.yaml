  key_concept: Definition and Purpose of Weapons
  name: weapon
- aspects:
  - content: Weapons can be classified as shock weapons (handheld, such as clubs and
      swords), missile weapons (projectiles powered by muscle, mechanical, or chemical
      means), and by their destructive mechanisms (kinetic or chemical energy). This
      classification helps in understanding the diverse nature of weaponry across
      different eras.
    type: Types
  - content: Shock weapons include clubs, maces, and swords. Missile weapons include
      javelins, slings, bows and arrows (muscle-powered), crossbows and catapults
      (mechanical-powered), and rockets, missiles, cannons, rifles, and pistols (chemical-powered).
    type: Examples
  - content: Conventional weapons destroy primarily by kinetic or chemical energy,
      such as bullets, bombs, and grenades. Nonconventional weapons include nuclear,
      chemical, and biological weapons, which have distinct mechanisms and implications
      for warfare.
    type: Conventional vs. Nonconventional
  - content: Understanding weapon classification is crucial for military strategy,
      international law, and arms control. The distinction between conventional and
      nonconventional weapons is especially significant in discussions of weapons
      of mass destruction and humanitarian law.

  key_concept: Classification of Weapons
  name: weapon
- aspects:
  - content: Offensive weapons are designed to attack and inflict harm, such as swords,
      guns, and bombs. Defensive weapons, while sometimes overlooked, include fortifications,
      armor, and helmets, which are intended to protect individuals or groups from
      harm.
    type: Definition and Distinction
  - content: Offensive examples include missiles, firearms, and chemical or nuclear
      bombs. Defensive examples are fortifications (walls, bunkers), personal armor
      (body armor, helmets), and shields.
    type: Examples
  - content: The line between offensive and defensive weapons can be blurred, as some
      equipment may serve both purposes depending on context. For example, a tank
      provides both firepower (offensive) and protection (defensive).
