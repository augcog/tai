  name: Red Bull
- aspects:
  - content: McLaren's disqualification refers to both their cars being excluded from
      the final results of the Las Vegas Grand Prix due to a breach of Article 3.5.9
      of the Technical Regulations, specifically regarding excessive plank wear (skid
      thickness below 9mm).
    type: Definition
  - content: Both Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri were initially classified in strong
      points positions but were later disqualified after post-race scrutineering found
      their cars' skid blocks worn beyond the legal limit. The team attributed this
      to unexpected porpoising and accidental damage.
    type: Examples
  - content: The disqualification resulted in McLaren losing valuable championship
      points at a critical stage, narrowing Norris' lead in the drivers' standings
      and affecting the team's position in the constructors' championship. It also
      highlighted the strict enforcement of technical regulations in F1.
