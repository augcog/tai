- aspects:
  - content: Surveillance and data collection in digital media refer to the systematic
      monitoring and recording of individuals' activities, behaviors, and preferences
      through digital platforms and devices. This includes the tracking of online
      browsing habits, media consumption, and personal communications by both private
      companies and government entities.
    type: Definition
  - content: Examples include publishers and entertainment companies monitoring what
      books, songs, or movies users download; digital video recorders collecting data
      on TV viewing habits; and companies like Google recording data from household
      wireless networks during mapping operations. These actions result in the creation
      of detailed user profiles and behavioral records.
    type: Examples
  - content: The implications of widespread surveillance include the erosion of personal
      privacy, the potential for misuse of collected data, and the creation of power
      imbalances between data collectors and individuals. Surveillance can be used
      for targeted advertising, but also for more intrusive purposes such as government
      monitoring or corporate profiling.
    type: Implications
  - content: The rise of digital media has blurred the boundaries between personal
      and professional life, as surveillance technologies extend into the home. This
      trend is connected to broader debates about privacy rights, data protection
      laws, and the ethical responsibilities of technology companies.

  name: Issues in new media
- aspects:
  - content: Spyware is software designed to covertly gather information from a device
      without the user's informed consent. Government surveillance refers to the monitoring
      of individuals' digital communications and activities by state authorities,
      often justified by security or law enforcement needs.
    type: Definition
  - content: The Pegasus spyware, developed by the NSO Group, is a prominent example;
      it can harvest calls, texts, photos, passwords, and location data from smartphones.
      While marketed for use against criminals and terrorists, Pegasus has been used
      to surveil politicians, activists, journalists, and dissidents, such as in the
      case of Jamal Khashoggi.
    type: Examples
  - content: Governments may use spyware for legitimate law enforcement operations,
      such as tracking money launderers or traffickers. However, edge cases arise
      when such tools are used for political repression, targeting opposition, or
      violating human rights, as seen in the misuse of Pegasus.
    type: Use Cases and Edge Cases
  - content: The use of spyware raises ethical and legal concerns about privacy, due
      process, and abuse of power. It challenges the balance between national security
      interests and individual rights, and can undermine trust in technology and government
      institutions.
    type: Implications
  - content: This topic connects to broader debates about encryption, lawful interception,
      international human rights, and the responsibilities of technology vendors in
      controlling the distribution and use of surveillance tools.

  name: Issues in new media
- aspects:
  - content: Geotagging is the process by which digital photos and videos are embedded
      with geographic location data, often automatically by devices equipped with
      GPS chips. This metadata can reveal precise locations associated with the media
      files.
    type: Definition
  - content: Photos taken with smartphones or digital cameras may contain geotags
      that, when uploaded online, allow viewers to determine the exact location where
      the image was captured. For instance, a photo posted on social media might inadvertently
      disclose the address of someone's home.
    type: Examples
  - content: The presence of geotags poses significant privacy and security risks,
      as malicious actors could use location data to target individuals or gain unauthorized
      access to private spaces. Many users are unaware of these risks, and disabling
      geotagging features can be complex.
    type: Implications
  - content: Public understanding of geotagging risks is limited, and some devices
      make it difficult to turn off location tagging. This lack of awareness and technical
      barriers increases the potential for unintentional privacy breaches.
    type: Edge Cases and Public Awareness
  - content: Geotagging intersects with broader issues of digital privacy, data security,
      and the responsibilities of device manufacturers and platforms to educate users
      and provide accessible privacy controls.
    type: Connections

  key_concept: Geotagging and Location Privacy Risks
  name: Issues in new media
- aspects:
  - content: Social network privacy settings are user-configurable options that determine
      who can view or access a user's personal information and content on platforms
      like Facebook. These settings are intended to give users control over their
      digital privacy.
    type: Definition
  - content: Facebook's privacy settings have evolved from restrictive defaults (content
      visible only to friends or friends of friends) to more open defaults (content
      visible to everyone), with users needing to 'opt-in' for greater privacy. In
      2009 and 2010, Facebook introduced more granular controls, but their complexity
      discouraged many users from adjusting them, resulting in widespread use of the
      least secure default settings.
    type: Examples
  - content: Complex or confusing privacy settings can lead to unintentional over-sharing
      of personal information, exposing users to risks such as identity theft, harassment,
      or unwanted contact. The design of privacy controls can influence user behavior
      and the overall security of personal data.
    type: Implications
  - content: After criticism regarding confusing privacy menus, Facebook simplified
      its privacy settings in 2010, consolidating them onto a single page. However,
      the challenge of balancing usability and security remains, as users often default
      to less secure options if settings are not straightforward.
    type: Edge Cases and Policy Response
  - content: This issue is linked to broader concerns about digital literacy, user
      autonomy, and the ethical responsibilities of social media companies to protect
      users' privacy by design.
    type: Connections
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:

    explanation: The complexity of privacy menus discouraged users from changing settings,
      resulting in widespread use of insecure defaults and increased exposure of personal
      information.
    options:
    - They were always set to the highest security by default
    - They were too simple and lacked options
    - They were complex, leading users to stick with insecure default settings
    - They prevented users from sharing any content
    question_text: What was a common issue with Facebook's privacy settings before
      2010?

- aspects:
  - content: Cyberbullying is the use of digital technologies, particularly the Internet,
      to threaten, harass, or humiliate individuals through words, images, or videos.
      It can occur via social media, messaging platforms, or other online forums.
    type: Definition
  - content: Notable cases include the 2010 suicide of a Rutgers University student
      after a video of his private encounter was streamed online, and the suicide
      of a 13-year-old Florida girl following a cyberbullying incident. Such events
      have brought national attention to the severity and consequences of online harassment.
    type: Examples
  - content: Cyberbullying can have devastating psychological effects, including depression,
      anxiety, and suicide. It poses unique challenges for law enforcement and educators
      due to the anonymity and reach of online platforms.
    type: Implications
  - content: In response, most U.S. states have enacted anti-bullying laws, though
      relatively few explicitly address cyberbullying. Advocacy groups, such as Hope’s
      Warriors, have emerged to raise awareness and support victims, but comprehensive
      legal frameworks remain limited.
    type: Legal and Social Responses
  - content: Cyberbullying is related to broader issues of digital citizenship, online
      ethics, and the responsibilities of platform providers to prevent abuse. It
      also intersects with debates on free speech, privacy, and the limits of regulation
      in digital spaces.
