sections:
- aspects:
  - content: For the 2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Pirelli has selected the C3 (hard),
      C4 (medium), and C5 (soft) tyre compounds for use at the Yas Marina Circuit.
      These compounds represent the hardest, medium, and softest options in Pirelli’s
      F1 range, with C3 being the most durable and C5 offering the highest grip but
      the fastest degradation. The selection is tailored to the circuit’s combination
      of high-speed straights and technical sections.
    type: Definition
  - content: Each driver will receive two sets of hard tyres (white), three sets of
      medium tyres (yellow), and eight sets of soft tyres (red) for the event. Additionally,
      green-marked intermediate tyres and blue-marked full wet tyres are available
      in case of rain. The allocation reflects the expectation that soft tyres may
      play a larger role in race strategy due to reduced graining at Yas Marina.
    type: Examples and Allocation
  - content: The tyre allocation and compound selection influence race strategy, as
      drivers must use at least two different slick compounds during a dry race. The
      abundance of soft tyres suggests teams may consider aggressive strategies, especially
      if tyre degradation remains low. An extra set of soft tyres is reserved for
      drivers reaching Q3 in qualifying, incentivizing performance in earlier sessions.
    type: Strategic Implications
  - content: The compound selection for Abu Dhabi is consistent with choices made
      for other circuits featuring a mix of fast and slow corners. The requirement
      to use two different compounds is a standard F1 regulation aimed at promoting
      strategic variety and on-track overtaking. The allocation system and compound
      choices are part of broader efforts to balance performance, safety, and entertainment.

    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: Pirelli has selected the C3, C4, and C5 compounds for the Abu Dhabi
      Grand Prix. F1 regulations require that, in dry conditions, each driver must
      use at least two different slick compounds during the race. The other options
      either list incorrect compound choices or incorrect usage requirements.
    options:
    - C1 (hard), C2 (medium), and C3 (soft); at least one compound must be used.
    - C3 (hard), C4 (medium), and C5 (soft); at least two different slick compounds
      must be used.
    - C2 (hard), C3 (medium), and C4 (soft); at least three compounds must be used.
    - C4 (hard), C5 (medium), and C6 (soft); only one compound is required.

  key_concept: 2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Tyre Compounds
  name: What tyres will the teams and drivers have for the 2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix?
- aspects:
  - content: Yas Marina Circuit features a blend of flat-out straights and tight,
      technical corners, which places varying demands on tyre performance. The final
      sector, in particular, requires significant traction, leading to thermal degradation,
      especially on the rear tyres.
    type: Track Characteristics
  - content: Historically, the circuit has been known for causing tyre graining, but
      recent improvements in tyre construction have limited this issue. In 2024 and
      2025, graining was minimal, and tyre degradation was primarily thermal rather
      than abrasive, allowing for longer stints and more flexible strategies.
    type: Graining and Degradation Trends
  - content: In the previous year’s race, 19 drivers started on medium tyres, with
      only Lewis Hamilton opting for hards. The most effective strategy was a one-stop,
      using hards for the second stint. Only one driver used softs solely to set the
      fastest lap, and only Fernando Alonso among the top ten finishers made two pit
      stops, illustrating the durability of the compounds at Yas Marina.
    type: Recent Race Examples
  - content: Given the limited graining and manageable degradation, teams may consider
      using the soft compound in the race, not just in qualifying. The flexibility
      in tyre choice could lead to more diverse strategies, with the potential for
      aggressive stints on softer compounds if conditions allow.
    type: Implications for 2025 Strategy
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: Recent races at Yas Marina have shown minimal graining and mostly
      thermal degradation, particularly on the rear tyres. This has allowed for longer
      stints and may make the soft compound viable for race strategy. The other options
      do not accurately reflect the circuit’s recent tyre performance.
    options:
    - High levels of graining and rapid degradation, requiring frequent pit stops.
    - Minimal graining and primarily thermal degradation, enabling longer stints and
      potential use of soft tyres in race strategy.
    - Abrupt tyre failures due to abrasive surface, limiting compound choices.
    - Consistent wet conditions, making wet tyres the primary race choice.
    question_text: What tyre performance characteristics have been observed at Yas
      Marina Circuit in recent years, and how might these affect race strategy for
      the 2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix?
  index: 53
  key_concept: Yas Marina Circuit Tyre Performance
  name: What tyres will the teams and drivers have for the 2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix?
- aspects:
  - content: 'Each driver receives a fixed allocation: two sets of hard, three sets
      of medium, and eight sets of soft tyres for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Additionally,
      intermediate (green) and full wet (blue) tyres are available for inclement weather.
      An extra set of softs is reserved for drivers who reach Q3 in qualifying.'
    type: Allocation Structure
  - content: FIA regulations mandate that, in dry races, drivers must use at least
      two different types of slick tyres. This rule is designed to encourage strategic
      diversity and prevent teams from running the entire race on a single compound.
    type: Regulatory Requirements
  - content: The allocation system affects how teams plan their qualifying and race
      strategies. With more soft tyres available, teams can prioritize performance
      in qualifying or attempt aggressive race strategies. The requirement to use
      two compounds means teams must balance pace and durability.
    type: Practical Implications
  - content: If the race is declared wet, the requirement to use two slick compounds
      is waived, and teams may use intermediates or wets as needed. The allocation
      of extra softs for Q3 participants incentivizes strong qualifying performance.
    type: Edge Cases and Exceptions
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: F1 rules require at least two different slick compounds to be used
      in dry races, promoting strategic variety. If the race is declared wet, this
      requirement is lifted, and teams can use intermediates or wets as needed. The
      other options misstate the regulations.
    options:
    - Teams can use only one type of tyre in all conditions; no exceptions.
    - Teams must use at least two different slick compounds in dry races, but this
      requirement is waived if the race is declared wet.
    - Teams are required to use all three compounds in every race.
    - No allocation limits exist; teams can use unlimited tyres.
