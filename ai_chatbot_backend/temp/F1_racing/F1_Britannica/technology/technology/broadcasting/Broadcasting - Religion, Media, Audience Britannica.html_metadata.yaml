      singing) and information-discussion (documentaries, interviews, debates). Some

- aspects:
  - content: In the early days of radio, issues such as fees, royalties, performing
      rights, and union relations were not a major concern, with entertainers often
      performing for publicity. Over time, as the economic impact of broadcasting
      became clear, these issues became central to the relationship between broadcasters
      and creative professionals.

      music, advocating for fair compensation through repeat fees or restrictions
      on recordings.

      to political pressures, as seen in cases like Czechoslovakia after the 1968
      political shift.
