**NOTE**

* Please run the SLAM on **Remote PC**.
* Make sure to launch the [Bringup](/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/bringup "/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/bringup") from TurtleBot3 before executing any operation.

The **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** is a technique to draw a map by estimating current location in an arbitrary space. The SLAM is a well-known feature of TurtleBot from its predecessors. The video here shows you how accurately TurtleBot3 can draw a map with its compact and affordable platform.

##[Run SLAM Node](#run-slam-node "#run-slam-node") (h2)

1. Run roscore from Remote PC.

```
$ roscore

```
2. If the `Bringup` is not running on the TurtleBot3 SBC, launch the Bringup. **Skip this step if you have launched bringup previously**.
	* Open a new terminal from Remote PC with `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `T` and connect to Raspberry Pi with its IP address.
	The default password is **turtlebot**.

	```
	$ ssh pi@{IP_ADDRESS_OF_RASPBERRY_PI}
	$ roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch

	```
3. Open a new terminal from Remote PC with `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `T` and launch the SLAM node. The Gmapping is used as a default SLAM method.
 Please use the proper keyword among `burger`, `waffle`, `waffle_pi` for the `TURTLEBOT3_MODEL` parameter.

```
$ export TURTLEBOT3\_MODEL=burger
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_slam turtlebot3_slam.launch

```

![](/assets/images/icon_unfold.png)

The `$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=${TB3_MODEL}` command can be omitted if the **TURTLEBOT3\_MODEL** parameter is predefined in the `.bashrc` file.  

The `.bashrc` file is automatically loaded when a terminal window is created.

* Example of defining `TurtlBot3 Burger` as a default model.

```
$ echo 'export TURTLEBOT3\_MODEL=burger' >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc

```
* Example of defining `TurtlBot3 Waffle Pi` as a default model.

##[Run Teleoperation Node](#run-teleoperation-node "#run-teleoperation-node") (h2)

Once SLAM node is successfully up and running, TurtleBot3 will be exploring unknown area of the map using teleoperation. It is important to avoid vigorous movements such as changing the linear and angular speed too quickly. When building a map using the TurtleBot3, it is a good practice to scan every corner of the map.

1. Open a new terminal and run the teleoperation node from the Remote PC.  

 Please use the proper keyword among `burger`, `waffle`, `waffle_pi` for the `TURTLEBOT3_MODEL` parameter.

```
$ export TURTLEBOT3\_MODEL=burger
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch

 Control Your TurtleBot3!

##[Tuning Guide](#tuning-guide "#tuning-guide") (h2)

Gmapping has many parameters to change performances for different environments. You can get an information about whole parameters in [ROS WiKi](http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping "http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping") or refer to the Chapter 11 of [ROS Robot Programming](https://community.robotsource.org/t/download-the-ros-robot-programming-book-for-free/51 "https://community.robotsource.org/t/download-the-ros-robot-programming-book-for-free/51").
This tuning guide provides tips when configuring gmapping parameters. If you want to optimize SLAM performances for your environments, this section might be helpful.

Below parameters are defined in `turtlebot3_slam/config/gmapping_params.yaml` file.

###map\_update\_interval (h3)

This parameter defines time between updating the map.  

The smaller the value, the more frequent the map is updated.  

However, setting this too small will be require more processing power for the map calculation. 
Set this parameter depending on the map environment.

Below parameters are defined in `turtlebot3_slam/config/gmapping_params.yaml` file.


###minimumScore (h3)

This parameter sets the minimum score value that determines the success or failure of the sensor’s scan data matching test. 
This can reduce errors in the expected position of the robot in a large area. 
If the parameter is set properly, you will see information similar to one shown below.

```
Average Scan Matching Score=278.965
neff= 100
Registering Scans:Done
update frame 6
update ld=2.95935e-05 ad=0.000302522
Laser Pose= -0.0320253 -5.36882e-06 -3.14142

```

If set too high, you might see below warnings.

```
Scan Matching Failed, using odometry. Likelihood=0
lp:-0.0306155 5.75314e-06 -3.14151
op:-0.0306156 5.90277e-06 -3.14151

These map data is drawn in the RViz window as the TurtleBot3 was traveling. 
After creating a complete map of desired area, save the map data to the local drive for the later use.

1. Launch the **map\_saver** node in the map\_server package to create map files.  

 The map file is saved in the directory where the map\_saver node is launched at.

* Make sure to launch the [Bringup](/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/bringup "/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/bringup") from TurtleBot3 before executing any operation.

The **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** is a technique to draw a map by estimating current location in an arbitrary space. The SLAM is a well-known feature of TurtleBot from its predecessors. The video here shows you how accurately TurtleBot3 can draw a map with its compact and affordable platform.

##[Map](#map "#map") (h2)

The map uses two-dimensional **Occupancy Grid Map (OGM)**, which is commonly used in ROS. 
The saved map will look like the figure below, where **white** area is collision free area while **black** area is occupied and inaccessible area, and **gray** area represents the unknown area. 
This map is used for the [Navigation](/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/navigation/#navigation "/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/navigation/#navigation").

The figure below shows the result of creating a large map using TurtleBot3. It took about an hour to create a map with a travel distance of about 350 meters.
