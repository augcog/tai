sections:
- aspects:
  - content: In architecture, a court is defined as an open area that is surrounded
      by buildings or walls. This space serves as a central, often communal, area
      within a larger architectural complex. Courts are distinct from open public
      squares in that they are enclosed or semi-enclosed by the structures of the
      building itself, providing both access and separation from the outside environment.
    type: definition
  - content: Courts have existed since the earliest recorded times and are found in
      the architectural traditions of virtually all civilizations. Their forms, functions,
      and symbolic meanings have evolved, but the basic principle of an enclosed open
      space has remained consistent. In ancient civilizations, courts often served
      as gathering places, ceremonial grounds, or organizational centers for domestic
      and civic life.
    type: historical development
  - content: In medieval Europe, courts were integral to major domestic buildings
      such as monasteries (where the cloister functioned as a court), castles (with
      their wards), and academic or medical institutions (with quadrangles in colleges
      and hospitals). These typologies demonstrate the court’s adaptability to various
      institutional and private uses, reflecting both practical and symbolic needs.
    type: examples and typologies
  - content: Courts are closely related to other architectural features such as atria,
      patios, quadrangles, and cortiles, each with its own cultural and functional
      nuances. For example, a patio is a Spanish or Latin American variant, while
      a cortile is an Italian Renaissance courtyard. Understanding these connections
      helps in tracing the diffusion and adaptation of the court form across regions
      and eras.

      covered hallways, or façades.

    - A public square surrounded by roads
    - An open area surrounded by buildings or walls
    - A covered hallway in a palace
    - A decorative façade on a building

- aspects:
  - content: In European history, courts became characteristic features of palaces
      and major domestic buildings. Their design evolved in response to changing social,
      functional, and aesthetic needs. Palaces, especially, often included complexes
      of multiple courts, each serving different purposes such as ceremonial gatherings,
      private retreats, or service functions.
    type: development in palatial and domestic architecture
  - content: The Alhambra in Granada, Spain, constructed in the 13th and 14th centuries,
      is a prime example, featuring six courts including the celebrated Court of the
      Lions and Court of the Myrtles. These courts exemplify the sophisticated spatial
      and decorative use of courts in Islamic palace architecture, serving as both
      aesthetic focal points and functional spaces.
    type: notable examples
  - content: In Tudor and Elizabethan England, 16th-century mansions often had a forecourt
      with projecting wings, reflecting both defensive and social functions. Similarly,
      large French houses adopted comparable layouts, but by the late 17th century,
      the need for service areas led to the addition of a second, rear courtyard for
      stables and coachhouses, while the front court evolved into the 'court of honour'
      (cour d’honneur).
    type: regional adaptations
  - content: The evolution of courts in European architecture reflects broader shifts
      in social organization, privacy, and the relationship between public and private
      spaces. The court of honour, for instance, became a symbol of prestige and ceremonial
      arrival, influencing later palatial and civic architecture across Europe and
      beyond.
