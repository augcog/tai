sections:
- aspects:
  - content: A packet-switched network is a type of digital network that transmits
      data by dividing it into small, discrete units called packets, which are routed
      independently through a series of nodes (switches) to their destination, where
      the original data is reassembled. This contrasts with circuit-switched networks,
      which maintain a dedicated path for the entire duration of a communication session.
    type: definition
  - content: The Internet and most local area networks (LANs) are prominent examples
      of packet-switched networks. These networks rely on packet switching to efficiently
      manage and route data traffic among millions of devices.
    type: examples
  - content: Packet-switched networks allow for more efficient use of network resources,
      as multiple communications can share the same transmission channels. This design
      is foundational for modern digital communications, enabling scalability and
      robustness in global networking infrastructures.
    type: implications
  - content: Packet-switched networks are closely related to concepts such as store-and-forward
      routing, protocols, and the broader development of computer networking. They
      underpin the architecture of the modern Internet and influence the design of
      communication protocols and network hardware.

    explanation: Packet-switched networks break data into packets that are routed
      independently, unlike circuit-switched networks which use a dedicated path.
      The other options describe features not characteristic of packet-switched networks.
    options:
    - It transmits data by breaking it into packets that are routed independently.
    - It establishes a dedicated physical path for the entire communication session.
    - It uses analog signals for data transmission.
    - It is only used in telephone networks.
    question_text: Which of the following statements best describes a packet-switched
      network?
  index: 137
  key_concept: packet-switched network fundamentals
  name: packet-switched network
- aspects:
  - content: 'Packet-switched networks are composed of two main components: cores
      and edges. The core consists of routers and control systems connected by high-bandwidth
      communication channels, while the edges are where end-user systems (hosts) reside.
      Communication across the core is governed by protocols, which define how data
      is formatted, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received.'
    type: technical structure
  - content: Data is broken into packets, each containing a header (with control information
      such as sender and receiver addresses) and a payload (the actual data). These
      packets may take different routes to the destination, where they are reassembled.
      If necessary, packets can be further fragmented into smaller units.
    type: data transmission process
  - content: 'There are two main types: connectionless (datagram) networks, where
      each packet is routed independently, and connection-oriented (virtual-circuit)
      networks, which establish a dedicated logical path before packet transfer, resembling
      circuit-switched networks in some respects.'
    type: types of packet-switched networks
  - content: Packet-switched networks optimize channel capacity and improve fault
      tolerance by rerouting packets if a path fails. However, they require significant
      processing power and memory, and can experience delays, packet loss, and out-of-order
      delivery, necessitating packet reassembly and error correction at the destination.
    type: practical considerations
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: Packet-switched networks optimize channel capacity and improve fault
      tolerance by allowing packets to be rerouted if a path fails. They actually
      require more processing power, and protocols are essential for their operation.
      Real-time delivery is not always guaranteed.
    options:
    - They require less processing power.
    - They optimize channel capacity and improve fault tolerance.
    - They guarantee real-time delivery for all applications.
    - They do not require any protocols for communication.
    question_text: What is a key advantage of packet-switched networks compared to
      circuit-switched networks?
  index: 257
  key_concept: packet-switched network architecture and operation
  name: Definition
- aspects:
  - content: Each packet, also known as a datagram, consists of a header and a payload.
      The header contains essential control information such as source and destination
      addresses, sequencing information, and error-checking data. The payload is the
      actual user data being transmitted.
    type: packet composition
  - content: Protocols are standardized procedures that govern how data is transmitted,
      routed, and received in a network. The set of protocols used for end-to-end
      communication is referred to as a protocol stack, with TCP/IP being the most
      widely used stack in packet-switched networks.
    type: protocols and protocol stacks
  - content: Packets may be fragmented into even smaller units to accommodate network
      constraints such as maximum transmission unit (MTU) sizes. At the destination,
      these fragments must be reassembled in the correct order to reconstruct the
      original data.
    type: fragmentation and reassembly
  - content: Connectionless protocols (such as UDP) send packets independently, while
      connection-oriented protocols (such as TCP) establish a logical connection and
      ensure reliable, ordered delivery, mimicking aspects of circuit-switched networks.
    type: connectionless vs. connection-oriented protocols
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 0
    explanation: The header of a data packet contains control information such as
      sender and receiver addresses, not the entire data file or network topology.
      Encryption keys may be included in some security protocols but are not a standard
      part of every packet header.
    options:
    - Sender and receiver addresses
    - The entire data file
    - Network core topology
    - Encryption keys for all nodes
    question_text: What information is typically found in the header of a data packet
      in a packet-switched network?
  index: 257
  key_concept: packet structure and protocols
  name: Definition
- aspects:
  - content: The concept of packet switching was first developed by Paul Baran at
      RAND Corporation in the early 1960s, who introduced 'hot-potato routing' to
      ensure network survivability during a nuclear attack. Independently, Donald
      Davies at the UK's National Physical Laboratory (NPL) developed similar ideas
      and coined the term 'packet.' Lawrence Roberts of ARPA adopted the concept for
      the ARPANET project after learning of Davies’s work.
    type: origin and key figures
  - content: ARPANET, designed by Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), was the first public
      packet-switched network, connecting four initial nodes in 1969 and expanding
      to 57 by 1975. Other early networks included the UK's Mark I and Mark II, France's
      TRANSPAC, Canada's DATAPAC, and Japan's planned public packet-switched network.
    type: early implementations
  - content: To facilitate international compatibility, five nations (Canada, France,
      Japan, UK, US) collaborated on standard protocols, resulting in the adoption
      of CCITT Recommendation X.25 in 1976, followed by X.75 for interconnecting international
      networks.
    type: standardization and global adoption
  - content: Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf developed the TCP/IP protocol suite, which
      became the standard for interconnecting diverse packet-switched networks, ultimately
      forming the foundation of the modern Internet.
