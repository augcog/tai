- aspects:
  - content: Open architecture networking is a design principle where networks with
      defined standard interfaces can interconnect regardless of their internal structure,
      using gateways to facilitate communication. TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
      Protocol) is a suite of communication protocols that enable different types
      of machines and networks to communicate and exchange data reliably. This approach
      was foundational to the Internet’s ability to scale and support heterogeneous
      systems.
    type: Definition
  - content: The concept was first implemented by DARPA in the 1970s to connect research
      networks in the US and Europe. Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn described the TCP
      protocol in 1974, which later included IP for global addressing. The US Department
      of Defense adopted TCP/IP as a standard in 1980, and it was soon endorsed by
      other researchers and technologists globally, enabling the growth of the Internet.
    type: Examples and Historical Context
  - content: Open architecture and TCP/IP allowed for the seamless integration of
      diverse networks, paving the way for the Internet’s global expansion. This standardization
      also meant that innovations in hardware and software could be rapidly adopted
      without compatibility issues. The grassroots development of Internet standards
      continues today through organizations like the Internet Engineering Task Force
      (IETF) and the Internet Society.
