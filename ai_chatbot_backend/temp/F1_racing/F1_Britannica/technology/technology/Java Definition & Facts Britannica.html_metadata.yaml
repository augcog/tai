  name: Java
- aspects:
  - content: Unlike traditional languages that compile code directly into instructions
      for a specific computer, Java code is compiled into an intermediate form known
      as Bytecode. This Bytecode is not tied to any particular hardware or operating
      system. Instead, it is interpreted by the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), also
      known as the Java virtual machine (JVM), which translates Bytecode into machine
      code appropriate for the host system.
    type: Technical mechanism
  - content: This approach enables the 'write once, run anywhere' philosophy, allowing
      Java programs to run on any device or operating system with a compatible JRE.
