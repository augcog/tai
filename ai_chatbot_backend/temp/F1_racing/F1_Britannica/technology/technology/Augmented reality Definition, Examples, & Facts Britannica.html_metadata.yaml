- aspects:
  - content: Augmented reality (AR) is a process in computer programming that combines
      or augments real-world video or photographic displays with computer-generated
      data. This overlay of digital information onto the physical world is designed
      to enhance the user's perception and interaction with their environment. AR
      differs from virtual reality, which creates entirely artificial environments,
      by instead supplementing reality with useful digital elements.
    type: Definition
  - content: Notable examples of AR include the yellow first-down lines superimposed
      on televised American football games and virtual flight paths for hockey pucks
      or golf balls. These overlays provide viewers with additional context or information
      that would not be visible in the raw video footage, making the experience more
      informative and engaging.
    type: Examples
  - content: The core process of AR has significant implications for how information
      is accessed and understood in real time. By merging digital data with real-world
      views, AR can improve situational awareness, support decision-making, and create
      more immersive educational or entertainment experiences. The effectiveness of
      AR depends on both the accuracy of the digital overlay and the relevance of
      the information provided.

    - 1
    explanation: Augmented reality is defined by its ability to overlay computer-generated
      data onto real-world video or images, enhancing the user's perception of their
      environment. It does not create fully virtual environments or replace real objects,
      but supplements reality with digital information.
    options:
    - Creating entirely virtual environments for users to explore.
    - Overlaying computer-generated data onto real-world video or images.
    - Replacing real-world objects with digital simulations.
    - Displaying static images unrelated to the user's environment.
    question_text: Which of the following best describes the core process of augmented
      reality?
  index: 134
  key_concept: Definition and Core Process
  name: augmented reality
- aspects:
  - content: The earliest applications of augmented reality were found in military
      technology, particularly in 'heads-up-displays' (HUDs) for airplanes and tanks.
      These systems projected instrument panel-type information onto the cockpit canopy
      or viewfinder, allowing crew members to access critical data while maintaining
      a view of their surroundings.
    type: Context
  - content: Military HUDs are a classic example, where pilots or tank operators see
      speed, altitude, targeting, and navigation data superimposed directly onto their
      field of vision. This technology has since influenced civilian uses, such as
      the overlays in sports broadcasting that provide viewers with additional information
      during live events.
    type: Examples
  - content: The development of AR in military contexts demonstrates its value in
      situations requiring rapid information processing and situational awareness.
      The successful adaptation of these technologies to consumer media, like televised
      sports, highlights AR's versatility and potential for widespread adoption.
