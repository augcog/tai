- aspects:
  - content: The 1988 Formula 1 Race Results refer to the official outcomes of each
      Grand Prix in the 1988 F1 World Championship season. The results are typically
      presented in a tabular format, listing the Grand Prix name, date, winning driver,
      team, number of laps, and the winning time. This structure allows for easy comparison
      across different races and provides a comprehensive overview of the season's
      competitive landscape.
    type: Definition and Structure
  - content: During the 1988 season, McLaren Honda dominated, with drivers Ayrton
      Senna and Alain Prost winning all but one race. For example, Alain Prost won
      the Brazilian, Monaco, Mexican, French, Portuguese, Spanish, and Australian
      Grands Prix, while Ayrton Senna won in San Marino, Canada, Detroit, Great Britain,
      Germany, Hungary, Belgium, and Japan. The only exception was the Italian Grand
      Prix, won by Gerhard Berger for Ferrari. This highlights the exceptional performance
      of McLaren Honda and the rivalry between its drivers.
    type: Examples and Notable Outcomes
  - content: The 1988 season is historically significant due to McLaren Honda's near-total
      dominance, which is often cited as one of the most dominant seasons by a single
      team in F1 history. The results also reflect the intense competition between
      teammates Senna and Prost, which shaped the narrative of the championship and
      influenced F1's evolution in terms of team dynamics and technical regulations.
      The Italian Grand Prix stands out as a notable exception, symbolizing Ferrari's
      resilience and the emotional significance of a home victory shortly after the
      death of Enzo Ferrari.
    type: Implications and Historical Context
  - content: Race results are directly connected to the drivers' and constructors'
      championship standings, as points are awarded based on finishing positions.
      The 1988 results influenced the allocation of championship points, ultimately
      determining the season's world champion. Additionally, these results are part
      of the broader F1 historical archive, allowing for longitudinal analysis of
      team and driver performance over decades.
