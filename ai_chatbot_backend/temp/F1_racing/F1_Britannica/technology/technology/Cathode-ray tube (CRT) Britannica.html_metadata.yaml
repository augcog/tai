  explanation: Electron guns in CRTs are responsible for emitting and directing electron
    beams that strike the phosphor screen, producing visible images. They do not handle
    audio, power supply, or vacuum creation.
  knowledge_areas:
  - CRT operation
  - Electron guns
  options:
  - To generate and direct electron beams toward the phosphor-coated screen
  - To produce sound waves for audio output
  - To control the power supply to the CRT
  - To create a vacuum inside the tube

  explanation: The shadow mask or grille is used to align electron beams so each gun
    excites only its corresponding color phosphor, preventing color 'spillage' to
    adjacent pixels.

  - Deflection coils
  - Shadow mask or grille
  - Vacuum envelope
  - Phosphor coating

  explanation: Multicolored images in a CRT are created by three electron guns, each
    corresponding to red, green, or blue phosphors, whose outputs are combined through
    precise targeting.
  knowledge_areas:
  - CRT color technology
  - Image formation
  options:
  - By using a single electron gun to scan the screen at high speed
  - By combining the outputs of three electron guns (red, green, blue) and directing
    them to specific phosphors
  - By reflecting ambient light off a colored filter
  - By heating the phosphor coating to emit different wavelengths

  explanation: Flat-panel displays replaced CRTs primarily due to their advantages
    in size, weight, energy efficiency, and environmental friendliness, not because
    CRTs were incapable of color or too expensive.
  knowledge_areas:
  - CRT limitations
  - Technological evolution
  options:
  - CRTs were too expensive to manufacture
  - Flat-panel displays offered reduced size, weight, energy consumption, and environmental
    impact
  - CRTs could not display color images
  - Flat-panel displays used the same electron beam principle as CRTs

sections:
- aspects:
  - content: A cathode-ray tube (CRT) is a vacuum tube that displays images by directing
      beams of electrons onto a phosphorescent screen, causing it to emit visible
      light. The CRT is also known as the Braun tube, and it was a foundational technology
      for electronic visual displays throughout the 20th century. Its core components
      include an electron gun, a vacuum envelope, deflection systems, and a phosphor-coated
      screen.
    type: Definition
  - content: CRTs operate by emitting electrons from one or more electron guns, which
      are then accelerated and focused into a narrow beam. This beam is directed toward
      specific locations on the screen by magnetic or electrostatic deflection coils.
      When the electron beam strikes the phosphor coating, the energy is converted
      into visible light, creating an image. In color CRTs, three electron guns (for
      red, green, and blue) are used, and their beams are precisely aimed to generate
      full-color images through additive color mixing.
    type: Function and Operation
  - content: CRTs support a range of display modes, including monochrome (single electron
      gun) and color (three electron guns) configurations. Common video standards
      associated with CRTs include CGA (Color Graphics Adapter), VGA (Video Graphics
      Array), XGA (Extended Graphics Array), and SVGA (Super Video Graphics Array),
      each offering different resolutions and color capabilities. These standards
      were instrumental in the evolution of computer graphics and television display
      technologies.
    type: Display Modes and Standards
  - content: CRTs were widely used in television sets, computer monitors, oscilloscopes,
      and radar displays. For example, in color-television CRTs, three electron guns
      fire electrons toward a phosphor-coated screen, with a grille or shadow mask
      ensuring that each gun excites only its designated color phosphor. The technology
      enabled the development of early video games, broadcast television, and scientific
      instrumentation requiring real-time graphical output.
    type: Practical Examples and Applications
  - content: The CRT was a transformative technology, enabling the widespread adoption
      of electronic visual displays in both consumer and professional settings. Its
      operation illustrates principles of electron physics, electromagnetism, and
      materials science. The transition from CRTs to flat-panel displays (such as
      LCD and OLED) marked a significant technological shift, driven by CRT limitations
      in size, weight, energy consumption, and environmental concerns related to disposal.

    explanation: 'Options 0 and 2 are correct: CRTs use electron beams (option 0)
      and, in color models, three electron guns for RGB images (option 2). Option
      1 describes LCD technology, not CRTs. Option 3 is incorrect because a vacuum
      is essential for CRT operation.'
    options:
    - A CRT uses electron beams directed by magnetic fields to illuminate a phosphorescent
      screen.
    - A CRT generates images using liquid crystals manipulated by electric fields.
    - A CRT employs three electron guns in color displays to produce red, green, and
      blue images.
    - A CRT requires no vacuum for its operation.
