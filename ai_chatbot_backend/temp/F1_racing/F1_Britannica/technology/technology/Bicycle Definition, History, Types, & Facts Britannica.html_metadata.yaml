  - content: The introduction of pedals mounted on the front wheel in the early 1860s,
      notably by Pierre Lallement in France and later in the United States, represented
      a major innovation. Lallement's design used cranks and pedals to drive the front
      wheel, and he secured a U.S. patent in 1866. The Michaux family in Paris also
      built pedal-driven velocipedes in the mid-1860s, some with cast-iron frames
      for mass production.
    type: technological advancements
  - content: Although early treadle and pedal machines were not widely commercialized,
      they laid the foundation for the modern bicycle by introducing mechanical propulsion.
      The term 'bicycle' came into use in 1868, and the popularity of pedal-driven
      velocipedes in France and America set the stage for the bicycle's global spread.
