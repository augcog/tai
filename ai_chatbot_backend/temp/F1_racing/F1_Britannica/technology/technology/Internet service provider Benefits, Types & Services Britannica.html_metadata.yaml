sections:
- aspects:
  - content: An Internet service provider (ISP) is a company that provides Internet
      connections and related services to individuals and organizations. ISPs serve
      as the gateway for users to access the global Internet, facilitating both personal
      and business connectivity. Their foundational role is to ensure reliable and
      secure access to the Internet backbone for their customers.
    type: Definition
  - content: Beyond basic Internet connectivity, ISPs often offer additional services
      such as email accounts, software packages (like web browsers), personal web
      pages, and website hosting. For businesses, ISPs may also provide website building
      and hosting solutions, supporting a broad range of online activities and digital
      presence.
    type: Core Services
  - content: ISPs are interconnected through network access points, which are public
      network facilities that form part of the Internet backbone. This interconnectedness
      allows users of one ISP to communicate with users of another, ensuring the global
      reach and interoperability of the Internet.
    type: Network Structure
  - content: Examples of ISPs include large companies like Verizon, Comcast, and AT&T,
      as well as smaller regional providers. ISPs can serve residential customers,
      businesses, or both, and may operate at local, regional, national, or international
      levels.

- aspects:
  - content: The commercialization of the Internet accelerated in the 1980s and 1990s
      due to several technological and policy developments. The introduction of affordable
      personal computers and workstations, advances in integrated circuit technology,
      and the emergence of local area networks (LANs) such as Ethernet enabled more
      widespread Internet access.
    type: Early History
  - content: A key turning point came in 1993 when U.S. federal legislation allowed
      the National Science Foundation (NSF) to open the NSFNET backbone to commercial
      users. This change removed restrictions that previously limited commercial use
      to research-related activities, paving the way for private ISPs to flourish.
    type: Policy Shifts
  - content: The release of the Mosaic web browser by the University of Illinois in
      1993, followed by commercial browsers like Netscape Navigator and Microsoft
      Internet Explorer, made Internet access more user-friendly and accessible to
      the general public. These innovations contributed to rapid Internet adoption
      and traffic growth.
    type: Browser and Software Innovations
  - content: By the late 1990s, there were about 10,000 ISPs globally, with a majority
      in the United States. Companies like America Online (AOL) transitioned from
      dial-up information services to become leading ISPs with millions of subscribers.
      State-owned ISPs also emerged in large markets such as China and India, quickly
      surpassing traditional commercial ISPs in scale.

  name: Internet service provider
- aspects:
  - content: ISPs offer various types of Internet connections, including dial-up,
      broadband (such as DSL, cable, and fiber-optic), and wireless services. Dial-up
      was the earliest and slowest form, while broadband technologies provide much
      higher speeds and reliability.
    type: Connection Types
  - content: Many ISPs, especially in the United States, bundle Internet service with
      other offerings like telephone and cable television. This bundling can provide
      cost savings and convenience for consumers, making broadband more attractive
      than dial-up.
    type: Service Bundling
  - content: The early 21st century saw a major shift from dial-up to broadband, driven
      by the demand for faster Internet to support applications like video streaming.
      As of 2020, over 120 million U.S. households had broadband, and legacy dial-up
      providers like AOL saw massive declines in subscribers.
    type: Market Shifts
  - content: The proliferation of broadband enabled new services such as streaming
      video (e.g., Netflix) and online gaming, which require higher bandwidth. ISPs
      adapted by offering tiered service plans and investing in network infrastructure
      to support increased demand.

  name: Internet service provider
- aspects:
  - content: By the late 1990s, the ISP industry experienced significant consolidation,
      with many small and medium-sized providers merging or being acquired by larger
      companies. This trend reduced the number of independent ISPs and increased the
      market share of a few dominant players.
    type: Consolidation Trends
  - content: While the United States initially had the majority of ISPs, the global
      market rapidly expanded, especially with the entry of state-owned ISPs in populous
      countries like China, India, and Indonesia. These state-backed providers quickly
      gained massive subscriber bases, often surpassing traditional commercial ISPs.
    type: Global Expansion
  - content: America Online (AOL) became a leading ISP with over 25 million subscribers
      worldwide by 2000, expanding into regions such as Australia, Europe, South America,
      and Asia. In contrast, new state-owned ISPs in large national markets rapidly
      eclipsed the subscriber numbers of established commercial ISPs.
    type: Examples
  - content: Consolidation led to fewer choices for consumers in some regions but
      also enabled ISPs to invest in larger, more robust infrastructure. Globalization
      increased Internet access worldwide, but also introduced new regulatory and
      competitive dynamics.
    type: Implications

    explanation: Consolidation reduced the number of small ISPs, while state-owned
      ISPs in large markets like China and India quickly gained massive subscriber
      bases, surpassing traditional commercial providers.

      market by the late 1990s?
  index: 142
  key_concept: Industry Consolidation and Globalization
  name: Internet service provider
- aspects:
  - content: Net neutrality is the principle that ISPs must treat all data transmitted
      over their networks equally, without discriminating or charging differently
      based on user, content, website, or application. This concept is central to
      debates about the fairness and openness of the Internet.
    type: Definition and Principle
  - content: Proponents argue that net neutrality prevents ISPs from favoring certain
      content or charging higher prices for higher bandwidth usage, ensuring equal
      access for all users and content providers. Opponents claim that without the
      ability to charge premiums for certain services, ISPs may lack the incentive
      or resources to invest in advanced infrastructure or security.
    type: Arguments For and Against
  - content: In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) initially
      issued orders supporting net neutrality in 2010 and 2015. However, these policies
      were reversed in 2017 under the Trump administration, reflecting the ongoing
      contentious nature of the issue.
    type: Regulatory Actions
  - content: Major content and software providers generally support net neutrality,
      while ISPs often oppose it. The outcome of these debates affects consumers'
      access to content, the business models of ISPs, and the overall structure of
      the Internet ecosystem.
    type: Implications and Stakeholders
