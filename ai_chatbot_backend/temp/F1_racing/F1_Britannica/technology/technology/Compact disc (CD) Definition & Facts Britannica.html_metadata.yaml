sections:
- aspects:
  - content: A compact disc (CD) is a molded plastic disc containing digital data
      that is read using a laser beam for the reproduction of recorded sound and other
      information. CDs are also known as digital audio discs, laser discs, or simply
      CDs. The data is encoded in the form of microscopic pits and lands on the disc's
      surface, which are interpreted as digital information.
    type: definition
  - content: The compact disc was co-invented by Philips Electronics NV and Sony Corporation
      in 1980 and was commercially introduced in 1982. It rapidly replaced the phonograph
      disc (record) as the dominant medium for high-fidelity recorded music. Over
      time, the CD format expanded beyond audio to include data storage for computers
      (CD-ROM) and entertainment systems (DVD).
    type: historical context
  - content: The introduction of the CD revolutionized the music and data storage
      industries by providing a durable, high-quality, and easily reproducible medium.
      Its digital nature allowed for error correction and high-fidelity sound reproduction,
      influencing subsequent technologies such as DVD, Blu-ray, and digital downloads.
      The CD also contributed to the decline of analog storage formats.

    - Sony Corporation and Philips Electronics NV; high-fidelity recorded music
    - Apple Inc. and IBM; computer data storage
    - Sony Corporation and Microsoft; video games
    - Philips Electronics NV and Toshiba; analog video recording

  key_concept: 'compact disc: definition and historical context'
  name: compact disc
- aspects:
  - content: A standard CD is 120 mm (4.75 inches) in diameter and 1.2 mm (0.05 inch)
      thick. It consists of a clear polycarbonate plastic substrate, a reflective
      metallic layer (usually aluminum), and a clear protective acrylic coating. The
      data is encoded as a series of microscopic pits and lands arranged in a spiral
      track running from the inner hole to the outer edge of the disc.
    type: definition and structure
  - content: Besides the standard size, a smaller CD single with a diameter of 80
      mm (3.1 inches) is also used for audio distribution. The pits can be as short
      as 0.83 micrometres, and the tracks are spaced 1.6 micrometres apart. DVDs,
      a related format, use a higher-powered laser and finer focus to achieve greater
      storage capacity by resolving shorter pits and narrower tracks.
    type: examples and variations
  - content: The physical design of the CD allows for large amounts of data to be
      stored in a compact, durable format. The use of polycarbonate plastic ensures
      transparency and toughness, while the reflective metallic layer enables precise
      reading by lasers. The spiral track and pit/land encoding are foundational to
      optical disc technology and influenced later media such as DVDs and Blu-ray
      discs.

- aspects:
  - content: CD recording and replication involve creating a 'glass master' from a
      digital tape master, which is then used to produce metal masters, mothers, and
      stampers for mass production. The process starts by modulating a blue laser
      to etch pits in a photosensitive layer on a spinning glass disc, forming the
      glass master. This is coated with nickel to create a metal master, which is
      used to make mothers and stampers. Molten polycarbonate is then injected into
      stampers to mold clear plastic discs, which are coated with aluminum and protected
      with acrylic.
    type: definition and process overview
  - content: Initially, a digital tape master was required, but by the mid-1990s,
      advances in computer technology allowed digital files to be sent directly from
      recording devices to computers, bypassing the need for tape. This streamlined
      the production process and enabled easier editing, storage, and transfer of
      high-quality digital audio.
    type: technological evolution
  - content: The CD replication process enabled high-volume, low-cost production of
      identical discs, ensuring consistent quality and widespread distribution. The
      shift to computer-based mastering facilitated the rise of home recording and
      independent music production. The process set standards for subsequent optical
      media manufacturing, influencing the production of DVDs and Blu-ray discs.

    explanation: The 'glass master' is an initial template from which metal masters
      are made for mass replication. It is not used as a consumer product, nor is
      it a protective layer or an analog storage medium.
    options:
    - To create an initial template for producing metal masters used in mass replication
    - To serve as the final product for consumer use
    - To act as the protective layer on the disc
    - To store analog audio signals for later conversion

  name: '[Recording](https://www.britannica.com/technology/digital-sound-recording
    "https://www.britannica.com/technology/digital-sound-recording") and replication'
- aspects:
  - content: CD playback involves scanning the disc's spiral track with a low-intensity
      infrared laser focused on the metallic reflective layer. The laser reads the
      sequence of pits and lands, which represent binary data (0s and 1s). The disc's
      rotation rate varies to maintain a constant scanning speed as the laser moves
      from the center outward.
    type: definition and operation
  - content: When the laser strikes a land, light is reflected to a photodiode, generating
      an electrical pulse. When it strikes a pit, destructive interference reduces
      the reflected light, resulting in no pulse. The sequence of pulses is converted
      from digital to analog form by a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), which also
      corrects for errors due to surface blemishes or misalignment. This ensures accurate
      audio reproduction.
    type: technical details and error correction
  - content: The optical scanning and digital encoding allow CDs to reproduce sound
      with high fidelity and minimal degradation over time. The system's error correction
      capabilities make CDs more reliable than analog media. The playback mechanism
      established the foundation for later optical media technologies, such as DVD
      and Blu-ray, which use similar principles but with higher data density.

    explanation: 'A CD player uses a laser to detect differences in reflected light
      intensity: lands reflect light to the photodiode, while pits cause destructive
      interference, reducing the reflected light. The other options do not describe
      the CD reading process.'
    options:
    - By detecting differences in reflected laser light intensity
    - By measuring the temperature of the disc surface
    - By reading magnetic fields encoded in the disc
    - By sensing vibrations from the disc's rotation
