sections:
- aspects:
  - content: 'A motion-picture camera is a complex photographic device designed to
      record a succession of images on a reel of film, with each exposure creating
      a single frame. Unlike still cameras, motion-picture cameras are engineered
      to capture images in rapid sequence, typically at 24 or 30 frames per second.
      The camera comprises several critical components: a body, film-transport system,
      lenses, shutter, and a viewing-focusing system.'
    type: Definition
  - content: The film-transport system is the distinguishing feature of motion-picture
      cameras, as it automatically advances the film after each exposure. The unexposed
      film is stored in a forward magazine, kept completely dark to prevent accidental
      exposure. Sprocket holes along the edges of the film are engaged by sprocket-driven
      gears, feeding the film into the exposure chamber. A mechanical claw mechanism
      pulls the film into place behind the shutter, locks it for exposure, and then
      advances it for the next frame. This process ensures each frame is stationary
      during exposure and that the sequence of images can later be projected as a
      moving picture.
    type: Film Transport System
  - content: 'Motion-picture cameras typically expose film at a rate of 24 or 30 frames
      per second, which is essential for creating the illusion of continuous motion
      when projected. The film used can vary in width, with common formats being 8
      mm, 16 mm, 35 mm, and 70 mm. Each format has its own historical and practical
      significance: for instance, 35 mm has been the industry standard for theatrical
      releases, while 16 mm is often used in educational or independent filmmaking.'
    type: Frame Rate and Film Formats
  - content: The design of the motion-picture camera, particularly the film-transport
      system, directly affects the quality and consistency of the recorded images.
      Innovations such as the motor-driven system and mechanical claw enable precise
      frame-by-frame exposure, which is crucial for editing and synchronization with
      sound. The camera's structure also influences other aspects of filmmaking, such
      as portability, noise reduction (important for sound recording), and compatibility
      with various lenses and accessories.

  name: motion-picture camera
- aspects:
  - content: The shutter in a motion-picture camera is a device that controls when
      light reaches the film, allowing for precise exposure of each frame. Typically,
      it is a rotary shutter, shaped as a half-circle, that pivots in synchronization
      with the film's movement. The shutter blocks light when the film is being advanced
      and opens to expose the film when it is stationary.
    type: Definition and Function
  - content: The rotary shutter's movement is carefully synchronized with the mechanical
      claw's pulldown of the film. This ensures that the film is only exposed to light
      when it is completely still, preventing motion blur and ensuring each frame
      is sharp. The timing of the shutter is crucial for consistent exposure and image
      clarity.
    type: Synchronization with Film Transport
  - content: In cameras designed for sound filming, internal insulation is often added
      to dampen the noise created by the moving parts, including the shutter. This
      is necessary to avoid unwanted mechanical noise being picked up by sensitive
      microphones during synchronized sound recording.
    type: Implications for Sound Filming
  - content: The design and speed of the shutter affect exposure time, motion blur,
      and the overall sharpness of the image. Innovations in shutter technology have
      allowed filmmakers to capture fast action and achieve various visual effects,
      such as the 'strobe' look or smooth motion.
    type: Connections to Image Quality
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 2
    explanation: The rotary shutter's main function is to block light when the film
      is moving and allow light to reach the film when it is stationary for exposure.
      It does not focus the image, record sound, or transport the film.
    options:
    - To focus the image onto the film
    - To synchronize sound recording
    - To block and allow light during film advancement and exposure
    - To transport the film through the camera

  name: motion-picture camera
- aspects:
  - content: Most modern motion-picture cameras use a reflex viewing system, which
      employs a mirror to divert some of the light entering through the lens to the
      viewfinder. This allows the camera operator to see exactly what will be recorded
      on film, aiding in precise composition and focus.
    type: Reflex Viewing System
  - content: Accurate viewing and focusing are essential for achieving the desired
      visual effects and storytelling in filmmaking. The reflex system provides real-time
      feedback, enabling cinematographers to make adjustments to framing, focus, and
      depth of field before and during shooting.
    type: Importance for Cinematography
  - content: Earlier or simpler cameras may use non-reflex systems, such as parallax
      viewfinders, which do not show the exact image that will be captured. This can
      lead to errors in framing and focus, especially when using lenses with shallow
      depth of field.
    type: Alternative Systems
  - content: The effectiveness of the viewing and focusing system is closely linked
      to the type of lens used. Zoom, wide-angle, and telephoto lenses each present
