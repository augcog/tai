  question_text: In what way are the 2026 F1 tyres physically different from previous
    years?
  question_type: recap
- correct_answers:
  - 2
  explanation: The tyre compound update was developed in close collaboration with
    teams and the FIA, using simulation data to ensure compatibility with new car
    and power unit regulations.
  knowledge_areas:
  - 2026 Pirelli F1 Tyre Compounds
  options:
  - It is unrelated to other technical regulations
  - It was developed in isolation from team and FIA input
  - It integrates with new car and power unit regulations, using team simulations
  - It only affects wet weather racing

sections:
- aspects:
  - content: For the 2026 Formula 1 season, Pirelli has confirmed that teams will
      use a selection of three compounds per race, chosen from a range of five (C1
      to C5), with the C6 compound being discontinued. This structure maintains the
      practice from previous seasons but with a narrower selection, reflecting both
      regulatory changes and technical feedback. The compounds are differentiated
      by their rubber composition, which affects grip, durability, and optimal operating
      conditions.
    type: Definition and Structure
  - content: The selection of the 2026 tyre compounds was based on extensive data
      analysis from recent tests, including a significant session in Mexico City and
      further validation in Abu Dhabi. Pirelli utilized forecast data and simulations
      provided by F1 teams, focusing on the anticipated loads and speeds of the next-generation
      cars. Testing included the use of 'mule cars'—vehicles modified to simulate
      the 2026 car characteristics—ensuring the compounds meet performance and safety
      targets.
    type: Development Process and Testing
  - content: The removal of the C6 compound, which was previously used at circuits
      like Imola and Monaco, is intended to create clearer strategic differences between
      tyre choices. By narrowing the compound range, Pirelli aims to enhance the tactical
      element of races, forcing teams to make more distinct decisions regarding tyre
      selection, stint lengths, and pit stop timing. The expectation is that this
      will increase on-track variability and potentially influence race outcomes.
    type: Implications for Race Strategy
  - content: 'In addition to the compound changes, the 2026 season will see cars running
      on slightly narrower 18-inch tyres compared to previous years. This change aligns
      with broader technical regulations aimed at reducing drag and adapting to new
      car designs. The tyre development objectives remain consistent with previous
      seasons: ensuring safety, performance, and adaptability across a 24-race calendar.'
    type: Technical Adjustments for 2026
  - content: The tyre compound update is part of a larger regulatory overhaul for
      2026, which includes new car specifications and power unit rules. Tyre development
      had to anticipate these changes, integrating simulation data and feedback from
      teams to ensure compatibility. The collaborative process between Pirelli, the
      FIA, and F1 teams exemplifies the interconnected nature of technical and sporting
      regulations in modern Formula 1.

  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: The C6 compound is being discontinued for 2026, so only C1 to C5
      will be available. Tyres will be slightly narrower, not wider, and compound
      selection is subject to FIA approval.
    options:
    - Teams can choose from six compounds (C1 to C6) at each race.
    - The C6 compound will not be available in 2026.
    - All tyres will be wider than in 2025.
    - Tyre selection is independent of FIA approval.
