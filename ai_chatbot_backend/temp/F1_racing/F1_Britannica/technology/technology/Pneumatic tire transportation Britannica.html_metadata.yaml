- aspects:
  - content: A pneumatic tire is a flexible covering for a wheel that contains and
      restrains compressed air. It consists of an impermeable lining to hold the air,
      and a rubber tread portion designed to withstand the cutting and abrasive wear
      from contact with the road. The compressed air inside the tire provides cushioning
      and flexibility, which is essential for vehicle comfort and performance.
    type: Definition
  - content: Examples of pneumatic tires include those found on cars, bicycles, motorcycles,
      trucks, and airplanes. Each application may require different tread patterns,
      sizes, and rubber compounds, but all share the basic principle of using compressed
      air for support and shock absorption.
    type: Examples
  - content: The introduction of pneumatic tires revolutionized transportation by
      dramatically improving ride comfort, traction, and vehicle speed. Their ability
      to absorb shocks from rough surfaces reduced wear on vehicles and infrastructure.
      However, pneumatic tires are susceptible to punctures and require regular maintenance,
      such as air pressure checks.
    type: Implications
  - content: Pneumatic tires are closely related to advancements in vehicle suspension
      systems, road construction, and rubber technology. Their development paralleled
      the rise of the automobile and bicycle industries, and they remain a critical
      component of modern transportation.

- aspects:
  - content: Robert William Thomson, a Scottish inventor, acquired a patent for the
      pneumatic tire in the 19th century. His design featured a hollow leather tire
      enclosing a rubberized fabric tube filled with air, which was a significant
      innovation over solid wheels.
    type: Historical Context
  - content: Thomson's 'aerial wheels' were tested on an English brougham and reportedly
      ran for 1,200 miles (about 2,000 km), demonstrating the durability and potential
      of pneumatic tires even in their early form.
    type: Examples
  - content: Despite the technical success, the high cost of rubber for the inner
      tubes made widespread adoption impractical at the time. This economic barrier
      delayed the mass use of pneumatic tires until later technological and manufacturing
      advances reduced costs.
    type: Challenges and Limitations
  - content: Thomson's work laid the groundwork for future inventors and spurred further
      research into air-filled tires. His invention demonstrated the practical benefits
      of pneumatic tires, influencing subsequent developments by others like Dunlop
      and Michelin.
