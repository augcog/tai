  question_text: What is the primary feature that distinguishes a moped from other
    two-wheeled motor vehicles?
  question_type: recap
- correct_answers:
  - 2
  explanation: Mopeds are restricted from limited-access public roads because their
    low speed capability makes them unsuitable and potentially unsafe for fast-moving
    traffic.
  knowledge_areas:
  - Road use restrictions
  - Engine size and performance
  options:
  - They are too heavy.
  - Their fuel economy is too low.
  - Their low speed capability makes them unsafe for high-speed traffic.
  - They lack any engine power.

  explanation: Mopeds are known for their excellent fuel economy, often achieving
    as low as 2.4 liters per 100 km, which is much better than most cars and motorcycles.
  knowledge_areas:
  - Fuel economy
  options:
  - They consume about 10 liters per 100 km.
  - They achieve about 2.4 liters per 100 km (100 miles per gallon).
  - Their fuel economy is similar to that of a car.
  - They use more fuel than motorcycles.

  question_type: recap
- correct_answers:
  - 1
  explanation: Mopeds are especially advantageous for urban commuting due to their
    fuel efficiency, ease of use, and suitability for low-speed, short-distance travel.
  knowledge_areas:
  - Context and comparison
  - Fuel economy
  options:
  - Long-distance highway travel
  - Urban commuting with frequent stops and low speeds
  - Off-road racing
  - Transporting heavy cargo

  question_text: In what context are mopeds particularly advantageous compared to
    larger motorcycles?

sections:
- aspects:
  - content: A moped is a small, lightweight vehicle that combines a motor and pedals,
      with the term itself derived from 'motor pedal.' Mopeds are distinct from motorcycles
      and scooters due to their smaller engine size and the presence of pedals, which
      can be used to propel the vehicle manually or assist the engine.
    type: Definition
  - content: Mopeds typically feature very small engines, commonly around 50 cubic
      centimeters (cc). This engine size limits their maximum speed and acceleration,
      making them less powerful than motorcycles or larger scooters. The small engine
      is a defining feature that places mopeds in a unique regulatory and functional
      category.
    type: Engine size and performance
  - content: One of the most notable characteristics of mopeds is their exceptional
      fuel economy. They can achieve fuel consumption rates as low as 2.4 liters per
      100 kilometers, or approximately 100 miles per gallon. This efficiency makes
      them attractive for short-distance commuting and urban transportation, especially
      where fuel costs or environmental concerns are significant.
    type: Fuel economy
  - content: Due to their limited speed capabilities, mopeds are generally not permitted
      on limited-access public roads, such as highways or expressways. Their design
      and performance are intended for local or city streets, where lower speeds are
      appropriate and safer for both the rider and other road users.
    type: Road use restrictions
  - content: Mopeds represent the smallest class of motorized two-wheeled vehicles,
      sitting below scooters and motorcycles in terms of engine size and speed. They
      are especially popular in regions with dense urban environments or where licensing
      and insurance requirements are less stringent for low-powered vehicles. Their
      design reflects a compromise between the convenience of motorized transport
      and the simplicity and accessibility of bicycles.

    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: A typical moped is defined by its small engine (around 50 cc) and
      the presence of pedals, which distinguishes it from larger motorcycles and scooters.
      It is not allowed on limited-access highways due to low speed, and it is known
      for excellent fuel economy, not higher consumption.
    options:
    - It has a large engine, usually over 250 cc.
    - It combines a small engine (around 50 cc) with pedals.
    - It is permitted on limited-access highways due to its high speed.
    - It consumes significantly more fuel than a standard motorcycle.
