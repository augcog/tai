  name: LEAF
- aspects:
  - content: The transition to electric and hybrid cars refers to the automotive industry's
      strategic shift from producing vehicles powered by internal-combustion engines
      (ICEs) to those powered by electric motors, either fully (electric vehicles)
      or in combination with ICEs (hybrid vehicles). This transition is driven by
      environmental, regulatory, and technological factors.
    type: Definition
  - content: Examples of vehicles representing this transition include the Nissan
      LEAF (2010), a fully electric car, and the Renault ZOE (2012), another prominent
      electric vehicle. Many manufacturers have announced plans to produce mostly
      or only electric and hybrid vehicles, with some aiming to phase out new ICE
      models by the 2030s.
    type: Examples
  - content: This trend has significant implications for global emissions, energy
      use, and automotive technology. Major car companies are investing heavily in
      battery technology, charging infrastructure, and new manufacturing processes.
      The shift is also influencing government policy, urban planning, and consumer
      behavior toward more sustainable transportation options.
    type: Implications and Industry Trends
  - content: The move toward electrification is part of a broader response to climate
      change, air pollution, and resource depletion. By the 2030s, many automakers
      intend to cease development of new ICE models, signaling a fundamental transformation
      in how vehicles are designed, produced, and used. This transition is expected
      to accelerate as battery costs decline and charging infrastructure expands.
