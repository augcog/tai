- aspects:
  - content: A personal computer (PC) is a digital computer designed for use by only
      one person at a time. It typically consists of a central processing unit (CPU)
      with arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry on an integrated circuit, main
      memory such as RAM, auxiliary memory like hard disks or optical discs, and various
      peripheral devices including a display, keyboard, mouse, and printer. PCs are
      distinct from larger systems like mainframes or minicomputers, which are designed
      for multiple users or specialized tasks.
    type: definition
  - content: The basic architecture of a personal computer includes a CPU for processing,
      main memory (RAM) for active data, and auxiliary storage (e.g., hard disks,
      CD-ROMs, DVD-ROMs) for long-term data retention. Peripheral devices expand functionality,
      enabling input (keyboard, mouse), output (display, printer), and data exchange.
      The integration of these components on a single platform made PCs affordable
      and accessible for individual users.
    type: components and architecture
  - content: Personal computers are widely used for a variety of tasks, including
      word processing, spreadsheets, communication, gaming, and multimedia. Their
      accessibility has transformed education, business, and personal productivity,
      enabling individuals to perform complex tasks that previously required expensive,
      centralized computing resources. The PC revolution democratized computing power
      and fostered innovation in software and hardware.

      it is associated with larger, centralized computing systems. CPUs, RAM, and
      peripherals are standard in PCs.
    options:
    - Central processing unit (CPU)
    - Mainframe terminal
    - Random-access memory (RAM)
    - Peripheral devices such as a keyboard and mouse
    question_text: Which of the following is NOT typically considered a core component
      of a personal computer?
  index: 163
  key_concept: personal computer
  name: personal computer
- aspects:
  - content: The era of personal computing began in the 1970s with the advent of microprocessors,
      which allowed for the creation of affordable, small computers suitable for individual
      use. Early hobbyist computers like the Altair 8800 (using the Intel 8080 microprocessor)
      were popular among enthusiasts but had limited commercial appeal due to their
      complexity and lack of user-friendly features.
    type: historical context
  - content: 'The personal computer industry truly took off in 1977 with the introduction
      of three mass-produced, preassembled computers: the Apple II, Tandy Radio Shack
      TRS-80, and Commodore PET. These machines used 8-bit microprocessors and had
      limited memory but were much cheaper than mainframes, making them accessible
      to individuals, small businesses, and schools. The TRS-80’s affordability and
      distribution through Radio Shack stores made it a market leader, while the Apple
      II gained popularity as the host for VisiCalc, the first electronic spreadsheet.'
    type: key developments and examples
  - content: The shift from hobbyist kits to preassembled, user-friendly computers
      marked the start of the PC industry. These early machines made computing accessible
      to a much broader audience and spurred the development of application software,
      which in turn increased the utility and appeal of personal computers. The success
      of these systems set the stage for further innovation and competition in the
      industry.

- aspects:
  - content: The IBM Personal Computer (PC) was introduced in 1981 by IBM, the dominant
      computer manufacturer at the time. It featured a significantly faster processor,
      greater memory capacity (about ten times that of competitors), and was supported
      by IBM’s extensive sales and support network. The standard operating system
      was MS-DOS, supplied by Microsoft.
    type: introduction and features
  - content: The IBM PC rapidly became the world's most popular personal computer,
      setting industry standards for both hardware (Intel 8088 microprocessor) and
      software (MS-DOS operating system). Its architecture was widely copied, giving
      rise to 'IBM compatibles' and 'IBM clones,' which either competed on enhanced
      features or lower price, respectively. This standardization fostered a large
      ecosystem of compatible hardware and software.
    type: industry impact and standardization
  - content: The IBM PC was the platform for influential software such as Lotus 1-2-3,
      a leading spreadsheet program that contributed to its widespread adoption in
      business. The availability of powerful applications further cemented the IBM
      PC's position as the dominant platform in the personal computing market.

- aspects:
  - content: A graphical user interface (GUI) is a display format that allows users
      to interact with a computer using visual elements like icons, windows, and menus,
      typically manipulated with a mouse. This contrasts with earlier text-based interfaces
      that required users to type commands. GUIs standardize interactions, making
      software easier to use and learn.
    type: definition and features
  - content: Apple introduced the Lisa computer in 1983, the first personal computer
      with a GUI, which allowed users to perform tasks by pointing and clicking rather
      than typing commands. The Lisa’s GUI became the foundation for the Macintosh,
      released in 1984, which was particularly successful in desktop publishing due
      to its ability to display text and graphics as they would appear when printed.
    type: historical development and examples
  - content: The GUI concept was widely adopted by other manufacturers and became
      a defining feature of modern personal computers. Microsoft introduced Windows
      in 1985, bringing GUI capabilities to MS-DOS-based PCs and eventually establishing
      Windows as the dominant operating environment. GUIs revolutionized usability,
      making computers accessible to non-technical users and enabling new categories
      of software.
