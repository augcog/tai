  name: What the teams said – Thursday in Las Vegas
- aspects:
  - content: Track evolution refers to the process by which a racing circuit's grip
      and surface conditions change as cars lay down rubber, especially on street
      circuits like Las Vegas that start 'green' and improve rapidly. Weather disruptions
      include rain and temperature changes that further affect track state and session
      flow.
    type: Definition
  - content: Pirelli noted significant track evolution due to the circuit being opened
      to traffic shortly before practice, leading to initially dirty conditions. Light
      rain and cold temperatures in FP2 disrupted running and made tyre warm-up difficult.
      Red flags (caused by incidents or track issues) also interrupted long-run data
      collection for several teams.
    type: Examples
  - content: Rapidly changing track conditions challenge teams to adapt car setups
      and tyre strategies in real time. Weather disruptions can reduce practice time,
      obscure true competitive order, and force teams to make setup decisions with
      incomplete data. This increases uncertainty for qualifying and race performance.
    type: Implications
  - content: Track evolution and weather are closely linked to tyre performance, driver
      feedback, and the ability to execute planned run programs. They also influence
      the effectiveness of different tyre compounds and the accuracy of performance
      comparisons between teams.

      practice sessions in Las Vegas?
  index: 356
  key_concept: Track Evolution and Weather Disruptions
  name: Pirelli
- aspects:
  - content: This concept encompasses how different tyre compounds (hard, medium,
      soft) performed under the unique conditions of the Las Vegas circuit, including
      issues like graining, warm-up, and suitability for qualifying versus race stints.
    type: Definition
  - content: Pirelli observed graining on medium and soft compounds due to low track
      temperatures, especially on the front axle. The hard tyre was tested by Kick
      Sauber and showed competitive lap times, suggesting it may be optimal for race
      strategy. Soft tyres were primarily used for qualifying simulations, with many
      drivers unable to complete clean laps due to red flags.
    type: Examples
  - content: Understanding tyre behaviour is critical for optimizing qualifying and
      race strategies. Teams must balance short-run pace with long-run durability,
      adapt to evolving track grip, and anticipate how weather will affect compound
      performance. Tyre choice can be a decisive factor in both qualifying position
      and race outcome.
    type: Implications
  - content: Tyre performance is interdependent with track evolution, weather, and
      car setup. Teams' ability to gather tyre data was hampered by session interruptions,
      making strategic decisions more complex and risk-prone.
    type: Connections
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: Pirelli noted that the hard tyre delivered lap times not far off
      the mediums and could be key for longer stints and flexible strategies, making
      it a strong race option.
    options:
    - It showed the highest wear rates
    - It delivered lap times close to the mediums and could enable longer stints
    - It was only used for qualifying simulations
    - It was not tested by any team
    question_text: Why did Pirelli suggest the hard tyre could be the ideal candidate
      for Sunday's race in Las Vegas?
