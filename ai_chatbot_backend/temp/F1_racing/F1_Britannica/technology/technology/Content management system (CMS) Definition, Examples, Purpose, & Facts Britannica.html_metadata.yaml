  question_type: recap
sections:
- aspects:
  - content: A content management system (CMS) is collaborative software designed
      for creating, modifying, and managing digital content, typically for websites.
      It enables users, even those without technical expertise, to produce and organize
      content efficiently. The CMS provides an accessible interface for content creation,
      editing, and publishing, often with built-in workflow controls and user role
      assignments.
    type: Definition
  - content: WordPress is the most prominent example, powering over 40% of all websites
      as of 2023. Other examples include Adobe PageMill, Microsoft FrontPage, and
      Alfresco. These platforms vary in complexity and specialization, from general-purpose
      website CMSs to systems focused on enterprise or document management.
    type: Examples
  - content: CMSs have democratized website creation, making it accessible and affordable
      for individuals and organizations. Users can set up sites by selecting templates
      and adjusting settings, often without needing technical staff. This ease of
      use has led to widespread adoption across various sectors.
    type: Practical Implications
  - content: CMSs are closely related to concepts like web development, digital publishing,
      and collaborative software. They intersect with digital asset management (DAM),
      document management systems (DMS), and enterprise content management (ECM).

    explanation: A CMS is defined as collaborative software for creating, modifying,
      and managing digital content, not a programming language, hardware device, or
      operating system.
    options:
    - A programming language for developing web applications
    - Collaborative software for creating, modifying, and managing digital content
    - A hardware device for storing website files
    - A type of operating system for servers
    question_text: Which of the following best describes a content management system
      (CMS)?
  index: 124
  key_concept: Definition and Core Functions of CMS
  name: content management system
- aspects:
  - content: 'A CMS is composed of two main parts: the Content Management Application
      (CMA) and the Content Delivery Application (CDA). The CMA is the user-facing
      component for creating, editing, and managing content, while the CDA is the
      backend system responsible for delivering content to end users.'
    type: Definition
  - content: In WordPress, the CMA is the dashboard where users write posts, manage
      media, and customize the site. The CDA retrieves content from the database and
      presents it to website visitors, guided by metadata and templates.
    type: Examples
  - content: This separation allows non-technical users to focus on content creation
      without worrying about how it is delivered or displayed. The flexibility of
      templates and metadata-driven presentation enables extensive customization of
      site appearance and functionality.
    type: Implications
  - content: The CMA/CDA architecture is foundational to most modern CMSs and is related
      to the broader concept of separating content from presentation in web development.
      It also underpins the evolution toward headless CMS architectures.

    question_text: What are the two main components of a traditional content management
      system (CMS)?
  index: 124
  key_concept: 'CMS Architecture: CMA and CDA'
  name: content management system
- aspects:
  - content: CMSs come in various forms, each tailored to specific content management
      needs. These include Web Content Management (WCM), Digital Asset Management
      (DAM), Document Management Systems (DMS), Component Content Management (CCM),
      and Enterprise Content Management (ECM).
    type: Definition
  - content: WCMs are used for managing website content, such as WordPress or Joomla.
      DAM systems are used by museums to manage graphics and multimedia, along with
      their metadata. DMSs focus on documents, while CCMs manage granular elements
      like images or paragraphs. ECMs facilitate collaboration across organizations.
    type: Examples
  - content: WCMs are ideal for publishing and updating website content. DAMs are
      essential for organizations with large multimedia collections. DMSs streamline
      document storage and retrieval. CCMs are used in technical documentation, and
      ECMs support large-scale information management and collaboration.
    type: Use Cases
  - content: These CMS types often overlap in functionality and may be integrated
      within organizations. Their development reflects the growing complexity and
      diversity of digital content management needs.

  key_concept: Types and Uses of CMS
  name: content management system
- aspects:
  - content: The first CMS was created by FileNet in 1995, followed by competitors
      and the coining of the term 'content management system' by Vignette in 1996.
      Early products like Adobe PageMill and Microsoft FrontPage helped popularize
      CMSs by lowering costs and making website creation more accessible.
    type: Historical Context
  - content: Adobe PageMill and FrontPage were treated as loss leaders by their parent
      companies, quickly driving down prices and spurring adoption. The rise of open-source
      CMSs in the early 2000s, such as WordPress (2003) and Alfresco (2006), further
      expanded access.
    type: Examples
  - content: The evolution of CMSs from expensive, specialized software to free, open-source
      platforms democratized web publishing. The introduction of templates and user-friendly
      interfaces enabled people without coding skills to build sophisticated websites.
    type: Implications
  - content: This history is intertwined with broader trends in software development,
      open-source movements, and the growth of the internet as a platform for self-publishing
      and collaboration.

  key_concept: Historical Evolution of CMS
  name: content management system
- aspects:
  - content: With the proliferation of smartphones and internet-connected devices,
      CMSs evolved to support content delivery beyond traditional desktops and laptops.
      The 'headless CMS' emerged, separating the content repository (backend) from
      the presentation layer (frontend).
    type: Definition
  - content: A headless CMS delivers content via an API, allowing it to be displayed
      on various devices such as smartphones, smartwatches, gaming consoles, and voice-activated
      devices. This contrasts with traditional CMSs, which are typically tied to a
      specific website frontend.
    type: Examples
  - content: Headless CMSs provide flexibility, enabling content to be reused and
      presented in multiple formats and channels. This is essential for organizations
      targeting diverse platforms and devices, supporting omnichannel strategies.
    type: Implications
  - content: The move toward headless CMS is part of a broader trend in software architecture,
      emphasizing APIs, modularity, and device-agnostic content delivery. It reflects
      the ongoing need for adaptability in digital content management.
