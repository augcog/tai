  question_type: recap
sections:
- aspects:
  - content: The 'tablero' is an architectural element characterized by a rectangular
      frontal panel, often found in Mesoamerican stepped pyramids. It is typically
      set above a sloping surface called the talud, forming part of the distinctive
      talud-tablero motif. The tablero is usually surrounded by a projecting frame,
      which both highlights and protects the recessed panel.
    type: Definition
  - content: The tablero is prominently featured in the architecture of Teotihuacán,
      one of the most influential pre-Columbian cities in Mesoamerica. It appears
      on each tier of stepped pyramids, such as the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid
      of the Moon. The motif has been identified in other Mesoamerican sites, demonstrating
      its cultural diffusion and importance.
    type: Examples and Context
  - content: The use of the tablero in monumental architecture reflects both aesthetic
      and symbolic values, possibly representing cosmological or societal hierarchies.
      Its widespread adoption suggests strong cultural and political connections between
      Teotihuacán and other Mesoamerican civilizations. The tablero also serves as
      a marker for identifying the influence of Teotihuacán in distant regions.
