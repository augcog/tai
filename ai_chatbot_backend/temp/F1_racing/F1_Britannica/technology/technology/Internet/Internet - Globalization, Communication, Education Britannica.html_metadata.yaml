sections:
- aspects:
  - content: This concept refers to the broad and transformative effects of the Internet
      on societies worldwide, shifting from a technical tool to an integral part of
      daily life. The Internet is not just a medium for information exchange but a
      lived environment where people work, socialize, and even experience aspects
      of their lives online. Its ubiquity has made it a fundamental infrastructure
      comparable to electricity or telephony.
    type: Definition and Scope
  - content: 'By the early 2000s, Internet adoption rates soared: 68% of American
      adults and 90% of teenagers had used it, with similar or higher rates in Europe
      and parts of Asia. However, there were significant disparities, with countries
      like Taiwan and Japan achieving over 50% penetration, while India and Vietnam
      lagged below 10%. South Korea led in broadband connectivity, illustrating both
      the rapid spread and uneven global distribution of Internet access.'
    type: Global Penetration and Statistics
  - content: The Internet's integration into daily routines has changed how individuals,
      corporations, and governments interact. It enables virtual realities and environments
      for work and socialization, blurring the lines between physical and digital
      existence. This shift raises new questions about community, identity, and the
      nature of human interaction in a digital age.
    type: Implications and Lived Experience

    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: The article emphasizes that the Internet has evolved from a technical
      tool to a lived environment affecting all aspects of society. It is not limited
      to technical or research use, nor is it only present in developed countries,
      though access does vary globally.
    options:
    - It is primarily a technical tool for data transfer.
    - It has become a lived environment integral to daily life.
    - Its use is limited to government and academic research.
    - It is only accessible in developed countries.
    question_text: Which of the following best describes the societal impact of the
      Internet according to the article?
  index: 180
  key_concept: Society and the Internet
  name: Society and the Internet
- aspects:
  - content: 'The Internet emerged from the convergence of two distinct technological
      agendas: the U.S. military''s Cold War networking efforts and the personal computer
      (PC) revolution. DARPA''s ARPANET project in the 1970s aimed to create a robust,
      decentralized network for transferring large data files among government and
      research labs, laying the groundwork for modern networking.'
    type: Historical Origins
  - content: The introduction of affordable personal computers like the Apple II (1977)
      and the IBM PC (1981) made computing accessible to individuals and small businesses.
      The standardization of PC hardware and operating systems, especially by IBM,
      facilitated widespread adoption and compatibility, fueling the growth of networked
      computing.
    type: Personal Computing Revolution
  - content: The Bay Area's counterculture and electronic hobbyist movements played
      a crucial role in democratizing computing, challenging the centralized 'priesthood'
      of mainframes. This grassroots ethos encouraged collaborative innovation and
      the spread of computing to the masses, setting the stage for the participatory
      culture of the Internet.
    type: Cultural and Social Context
  - content: The dual origins—military robustness and personal empowerment—shaped
      the Internet's architecture and culture. This synthesis enabled both secure,
      resilient networking and user-driven innovation, influencing everything from
      online communities to the open-source movement.
    type: Implications and Connections

    explanation: The article identifies the U.S. military's networking (ARPANET) and
      the personal computer revolution as the foundational agendas that converged
      to create the modern Internet.
    options:
    - Corporate expansion and mobile technology
    - Military networking and the personal computer revolution
    - Television broadcasting and print media

    question_text: What are the two main agendas that led to the development of the
      Internet?
  index: 304
  key_concept: Two agendas
  name: Two agendas
- aspects:
  - content: The WELL (Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link) was one of the earliest electronic
      bulletin board systems (BBS), founded in 1985 by Stewart Brand. It served as
      a pioneering online community where users could participate in subject-focused
      forums, laying the groundwork for modern online social interaction.
    type: Definition and Significance
  - content: 'The WELL exemplified features now common in online communities: geographic
      irrelevance, collective problem-solving, and emotional support. For instance,
      members rallied to help a parent whose child was diagnosed with leukemia, demonstrating
      the Internet''s capacity to marshal resources and provide community beyond physical
      boundaries.'
    type: Community Features and Culture
  - content: WELL forums were moderated to maintain focus and civility, with mechanisms
      to discipline disruptive users and the freedom to create new forums if disagreements
      arose. This democratic, self-organizing structure influenced later developments
      in online governance and community management.
    type: Moderation and Governance
  - content: The WELL became a template for diverse online communities, from religious
      and political groups to hobbyist forums. Its model of subject-based discussion,
      user moderation, and real-world meetups foreshadowed the rise of chat rooms,
      social networks, and specialized online groups.
    type: Legacy and Influence
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: The WELL was notable for its subject-based forums, democratic moderation,
      and open, community-driven participation, rather than geographic or commercial
      restrictions.
    options:
    - Strict geographic membership requirements
    - Subject-based forums and democratic moderation
    - Exclusive access for academic researchers
    - Focus on commercial transactions
    question_text: Which of the following features distinguished the WELL as an early
      online community?
  index: 312
  key_concept: The WELL
  name: The [WELL](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-WELL-Internet-community "https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-WELL-Internet-community")
- aspects:
  - content: Instant broadcast communication refers to the rapid, mass dissemination
      of information and coordination via Internet tools such as email, instant messaging
      (IM), and social media. These technologies have replaced or supplemented traditional
      communication forms like postal mail and phone calls.
    type: Definition and Evolution
  - content: Email and IM have enabled everything from 'smart mobs'—spontaneous gatherings
      organized online—to large-scale protests, disaster response, and performance
      art. Notable examples include the 1999 WTO protests in Seattle and the 2011
      Egyptian revolution, both coordinated using online platforms.
    type: Examples and Use Cases
  - content: The speed and reach of Internet communication have transformed social
      organization, activism, and even emergency response. Social media has empowered
      grassroots movements, facilitated charitable giving, and allowed for rapid information
      sharing during crises, although its effectiveness can be limited by infrastructure
      failures.
    type: Social and Political Implications
  - content: While the Internet can facilitate communication during disasters, its
      utility depends on the survival of supporting infrastructure. For example, during
      9/11, email was more reliable than phone calls, but in the Haiti earthquake,
      text messaging filled gaps for those without Internet access. Flash mobs illustrate
      the playful as well as serious uses of instant communication.
    type: Edge Cases and Limitations
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: Instant broadcast communication enables rapid, large-scale organization
      and coordination, as demonstrated by protests and disaster responses. It is
      not limited to entertainment or local participation.
    options:
    - It has made events slower to organize due to technical barriers.
    - It allows rapid, large-scale mobilization and coordination across distances.
    - It restricts participation to local communities only.
    - It is only used for entertainment purposes like flash mobs.
