sections:
- aspects:
  - content: A peripheral device is any device, including sensors, used to enter information
      and instructions into a computer for storage or processing, or to deliver processed
      data to a human operator or machine controlled by the computer. These devices
      are not part of the core computer architecture (CPU, memory, motherboard), but
      are external components that expand the computer’s functionality. They are also
      referred to as computer peripherals, input–output devices, or input/output devices.
    type: definition
  - content: 'Peripheral devices are commonly classified into three categories: input
      devices, output devices, and storage devices. Input devices convert data and
      instructions into a format (typically binary electrical signals) that the computer
      can process. Output devices translate processed computer data into forms intelligible
      to users or other machines. Storage devices, which often serve as both input
      and output devices, allow for the saving and retrieval of data.'
    type: types
  - content: Examples of input peripherals include keyboards, mice, trackballs, joysticks,
      trackpads, digital pens, microphones, webcams, digital cameras, and environmental
      sensors (e.g., temperature, pressure). Output peripherals include video display
      terminals, ink-jet and laser printers, loudspeakers, headphones, and machinery-controlling
      devices such as flow valves. Storage peripherals include CD-ROM and DVD drives,
      flash memory drives, and external disk drives. Some devices, such as USB hubs
      and video display terminals, can serve both input and output functions. Modern
      examples also encompass smartphones, tablets, and wearable devices like smartwatches
      and fitness trackers, which can function independently but also act as peripherals
      when connected to computers.
    type: examples
  - content: Peripheral devices are essential for human-computer interaction and for
      extending a computer’s capabilities. They facilitate data entry, processing,
      communication, and storage, making digital computers versatile tools for a wide
      range of applications. The evolution of peripherals reflects technological advances,
      such as the shift from punched-card readers to modern scanners and the increasing
      integration of wireless and multifunctional devices. The distinction between
      core and peripheral devices is sometimes blurred, especially as devices like
      smartphones can operate autonomously or as computer extensions. Peripheral connectivity
      standards, such as USB and SATA, are crucial for compatibility and performance.
    type: implications and connections
  - content: Peripheral devices connect to computers via various standards, which
      determine data transfer speed, compatibility, and ease of use. Serial Advanced
      Technology Attachment (SATA) is commonly used for magnetic disk drives. Connections
      can be serial (transmitting one bit at a time, using fewer wires and simpler
      design) or parallel (transmitting multiple bits simultaneously, requiring more
      wires and complexity). Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a widely adopted serial
      bus standard, enabling easy connection and hot-swapping of a broad range of
      peripherals. The choice of connection impacts device performance, user experience,
      and system expandability.

    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: Peripheral devices are external to the core computer architecture
      (CPU, main memory, motherboard) and are used for input, output, or storage functions.
      They are not software or a type of memory, and are distinct from the CPU itself.
    options:
    - A device that is part of the computer's central processing unit (CPU)
    - A device used to enter information into, or receive information from, a computer,
      but not part of its core architecture
    - A software program that manages computer hardware
    - A type of computer memory used for temporary storage
