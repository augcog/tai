  name: computer
- aspects:
  - content: Computers excel at handling large amounts of data, performing numerical
      calculations, making rapid decisions (e.g., routing telephone calls), controlling
      mechanical systems, and enabling new forms of research and automation. They
      are embedded in everyday appliances and can learn and adapt through machine
      learning techniques.

  - content: 'Despite their power, computers face theoretical and practical limitations.
      The halting problem is a classic example: some propositions are undecidable,
      meaning no algorithm can determine their truth in all cases. Practically, computers
      lack holistic reasoning and ethical judgment, relying solely on data and programmed
      logic.'
    type: Limitations
  - content: Computers can analyze DNA sequences, model consumer markets, and search
      large text databases. However, they cannot resolve undecidable propositions
      or replace the human element in social interactions.
