    the adoption of wireless networking?
  question_type: recap
sections:
- aspects:
  - content: Wi-Fi is a networking technology that utilizes radio waves to enable
      high-speed data transfer over short distances, typically within local area networks.
      It allows devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets to access broadband
      Internet wirelessly, eliminating the need for physical cables.
    type: Definition
  - content: Wi-Fi operates by dividing available frequency bands into multiple channels
      that overlap in frequency. To minimize interference and maximize efficiency,
      Wi-Fi uses channels that are far apart and employs a 'spread spectrum' technique,
      breaking a signal into pieces and transmitting them over multiple frequencies.
      This approach allows for lower power transmission per frequency and enables
      multiple devices to use the same transmitter. Wi-Fi signals can be affected
      by obstacles, leading to multipath interference, which is mitigated by using
      multiple transmission methods.
    type: Technical Operation
  - content: Wi-Fi is commonly used in homes, businesses, and public spaces to provide
      wireless Internet access. Devices connect to Wi-Fi hotspots, which are areas
      with Wi-Fi coverage, such as airports, coffee shops, and hotels. Some cities
      offer free citywide Wi-Fi networks, and Wi-Fi Direct enables device-to-device
      connections without a LAN.
    type: Examples and Use Cases
  - content: The adoption of Wi-Fi has transformed how people access the Internet,
      making connectivity more flexible and mobile. Its compatibility with a wide
      range of devices and environments has made it integral to modern computing and
      communication. Wi-Fi is closely related to other networking technologies like
      Ethernet and Bluetooth, but it is distinct in its use of radio waves for wireless
      local networking.

- aspects:
  - content: Prior to the establishment of a common standard, wireless networking
      technology was fragmented, with devices from different manufacturers often being
      incompatible. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission's 1985 decision to
      open certain radio frequency bands for unlicensed use set the stage for innovation
      in wireless networking.
    type: Historical Context
  - content: A committee of industry leaders developed a standardized protocol for
      wireless networking, resulting in the 802.11 standard, which was approved by
      the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 1997. This standard
      provided a foundation for interoperability among devices from different manufacturers.
    type: Standardization Process
  - content: The original 802.11 standard allowed for a maximum data transmission
      rate of 2 Mbps. Subsequent standards, such as 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6), have dramatically
      increased theoretical maximum speeds, reaching up to 9.6 Gbps. These advancements
      have enabled Wi-Fi to keep pace with growing demands for bandwidth and connectivity.
    type: Evolution of Standards
  - content: The creation of a common standard was crucial for widespread adoption
      and compatibility, fostering the growth of the Wi-Fi ecosystem. It allowed consumers
      and businesses to confidently purchase devices knowing they would work together,
      driving innovation and market expansion.
