  - content: International organizations in broadcasting are formal associations or
      unions composed of national or regional broadcasting bodies, established to
      coordinate, regulate, and promote cooperation in the field of radio and television
      transmission across borders. They may be global, regional, or specialized by
      function, and often facilitate technical standardization, frequency allocation,
      and information exchange.
    type: Definition
  - content: Key examples include the International Telecommunications Union (ITU),
      which became a UN specialized agency in 1947 and comprises bodies like the International
      Frequency Registration Board. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), founded
      in 1950, includes over 30 nations and associate members worldwide. Other regional
      unions include the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union, Union of National Radio
      and Television Organizations of Africa, Arab States Broadcasting Union, and
      the Caribbean Broadcasting Union, each with specific membership and headquarters.
