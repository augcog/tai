  question_text: Which of the following best describes the relationship between HTML,
    hypertext, and the World Wide Web?
  question_type: recap
sections:
- aspects:
  - content: HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is the standard system
      for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects
      on web pages. It is a markup language, not a programming language, meaning it
      is used to annotate and structure content rather than to perform computations
      or logic.
    type: Definition
  - content: HTML is used to format material for display in web browsers, enabling
      the creation of web pages that can include text, images, tables, and links to
      other pages. Each web page is an HTML document that can be retrieved and rendered
      by browsers over the Internet. HTML is foundational for all web development
      and is used in conjunction with other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.
    type: Function and Use Cases
  - content: HTML uses markup tags, such as <h1> for headings, <p> for paragraphs,
      and <table> for tables, to define the structure and presentation of content.
      For example, <A HREF="http://www.britannica.com">Encyclopædia Britannica</A>
      creates a hyperlink. Tags are interpreted by browsers to display content appropriately,
      adapting to screen size and available fonts.
    type: Examples and Syntax
  - content: HTML's design allows for the separation of content and presentation,
      facilitating accessibility and responsive design. It is closely related to other
      web technologies such as CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity),
      and is the backbone of the World Wide Web. Its simplicity and flexibility have
      contributed to the rapid expansion and accessibility of web content.

    explanation: HTML is a markup language, not a programming language or a database
      system. It is used to structure and format content for display in web browsers,
      not for computation or browsing itself.
    options:
    - A programming language used for computation
    - A markup language used to structure and format web content
    - A database management system
    - A software application for browsing the web
    question_text: Which of the following best describes HTML?
  index: 141
  key_concept: HTML as a Markup Language
  name: HTML
- aspects:
  - content: HTML was designed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, at CERN
      in Switzerland during the early 1990s. Its creation was motivated by the need
      to facilitate the sharing and linking of documents over the Internet, leading
      to the birth of the World Wide Web.
    type: Origins
  - content: Since its inception, HTML has undergone several revisions and standardizations,
      overseen by organizations such as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). These
      updates have expanded its capabilities, including support for multimedia, scripting,
      and improved accessibility.
    type: Evolution
  - content: HTML's development was pivotal in making the Internet accessible to a
      broad audience, enabling the creation of interconnected web pages and the rapid
      growth of web-based information sharing. It remains the foundation of web development
      today.
    type: Impact
  - content: HTML was influenced by earlier markup languages like SGML and has inspired
      the development of related technologies such as XML and XHTML. Its evolution
      is closely tied to the advancement of web browsers and the expansion of the
      Internet.
    type: Connection to Other Technologies

    question_text: Who is credited with inventing HTML, and where was it developed?
  index: 141
  key_concept: History and Development of HTML
  name: HTML
- aspects:
  - content: HTML documents are composed of elements marked by tags, such as headings
      (<h1> to <h6>), paragraphs (<p>), and tables (<table>). These tags define the
      structure and organization of content on a web page, allowing browsers to render
      the material appropriately.
    type: Core Elements
  - content: 'Tags are enclosed in angle brackets and often come in pairs: an opening
      tag (e.g., <p>) and a closing tag (e.g., </p>). Some tags, like <img>, are self-closing.
      Proper nesting and structure are important for browser compatibility and accessibility.'
    type: Syntax and Usage
  - content: A simple HTML document might include <h1> for a main heading, <p> for
      a paragraph, and <a href="url"> for a hyperlink. For instance, <A HREF="http://www.britannica.com">Encyclopædia
      Britannica</A> creates a clickable link to the Britannica website.
    type: Examples
  - content: Understanding HTML structure is essential for creating accessible and
      well-organized web pages. Proper use of tags ensures that content is readable
      by both humans and machines, including search engines and assistive technologies.

  key_concept: HTML Structure and Tags
  name: HTML
- aspects:
  - content: A web browser is a computer program that retrieves, interprets, and displays
      HTML documents from the Internet. Browsers read the markup tags in HTML files
      and render the content according to the specified structure and formatting.
    type: Definition and Function
  - content: Browsers adapt the presentation of HTML content to the device's screen
      size, available fonts, and user preferences. This flexibility allows web pages
      to be viewed on a wide range of devices, from desktop computers to smartphones.
    type: Adaptation and Display
  - content: Popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft
      Edge, and Safari. Each browser may interpret certain aspects of HTML slightly
      differently, making cross-browser compatibility an important consideration for
      web developers.
    type: Examples
  - content: Browsers play a critical role in the user experience of web content.
      Their ability to interpret HTML accurately and consistently is essential for
      accessibility, usability, and the overall effectiveness of web communication.
    type: Implications
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 2
    explanation: A web browser's main function is to interpret and display HTML documents,
      allowing users to view and interact with web pages.
    options:
    - To write HTML code
    - To store HTML documents on the server
    - To interpret and display HTML documents for users
    - To manage database connections
    question_text: What is the primary role of a web browser in relation to HTML?
  index: 141
  key_concept: Role of Browsers in HTML
  name: HTML
- aspects:
  - content: Hypertext refers to text that contains links (hyperlinks) to other documents
      or resources. In HTML, these links are created using anchor tags (<a>), which
      specify the destination URL and the clickable text.
    type: Definition
  - content: An anchor tag has the form <A HREF="URL">Link Text</A>, where the HREF
      attribute specifies the destination. For example, <A HREF="http://www.britannica.com">Encyclopædia
      Britannica</A> creates a link to the Britannica website, with the text 'Encyclopædia
      Britannica' underlined to indicate it is clickable.
    type: Syntax and Example
  - content: Anchors enable navigation between web pages and the integration of diverse
      resources, forming the interconnected structure of the World Wide Web. They
      can link to text, images, or other media, and can also be used for internal
      navigation within a page.
    type: Use Cases and Implications
  - content: Hypertext and anchors are fundamental to the concept of the web, distinguishing
      it from static documents. They enable non-linear navigation and are closely
      related to the development of search engines, web navigation, and information
      architecture.
