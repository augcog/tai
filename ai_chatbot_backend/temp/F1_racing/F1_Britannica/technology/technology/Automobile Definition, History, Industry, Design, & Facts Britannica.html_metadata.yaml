- aspects:
  - content: Vehicle stability refers to the automobile's ability to maintain controlled
      motion, especially at high speeds or under challenging conditions. Key factors
      influencing stability include the distribution of weight between the front and
      rear wheels, the height and position of the center of gravity, suspension characteristics,
      and which wheels are used for propulsion.
    type: definition and key factors
  - content: For high-speed road vehicles, optimized weight distribution and suspension
      tuning are critical for handling and passenger comfort. The common practice
      of front-mounted engines is due to the stability benefits it provides, but advancements
      like aluminum engines have enabled rear-mounted configurations without sacrificing
      stability. Off-road vehicles, by contrast, prioritize durability and overload
      resistance over high-speed stability.
    type: examples and practical implications
  - content: Stability considerations directly influence engineering choices such
      as engine placement, chassis design, and material selection. These factors are
      interrelated with safety, performance, and consumer preferences, making stability
      a central concern in both the design and regulatory evaluation of automobiles.
