sections:
- aspects:
  - content: A motorboat, also known as a powerboat, is a relatively small watercraft
      propelled by an internal-combustion or electric engine. These boats can range
      from tiny, single-person craft to large seagoing vessels over 100 feet (30 meters)
      in length, though most accommodate six or fewer passengers. The defining feature
      is the use of a motor for propulsion, distinguishing them from sailboats or
      rowboats which rely on wind or manual effort.
    type: definition
  - content: Motorboats serve a wide array of purposes, including recreational cruising,
      fishing, duck hunting, swimming, skin diving, and water skiing. In addition
      to leisure activities, they are used in sports such as racing and piloting/navigation
      contests. Their versatility extends to both personal enjoyment and competitive
      or functional roles on the water.
    type: uses and functions
  - content: Unlike sailboats, which depend on wind, or rowboats, which require manual
      rowing, motorboats offer greater speed and maneuverability due to their engine-driven
      propulsion. This makes them suitable for activities where precise control or
      higher speeds are necessary, such as water sports or rapid transportation. Their
      development paralleled advances in engine technology, which allowed for broader
      adoption and more specialized designs.

    explanation: Motorboats are defined by their use of an internal-combustion or
      electric engine for propulsion, unlike sailboats (wind) or rowboats (manual
      power). They can vary greatly in size and are used for multiple purposes, not
      just racing.
    options:
    - It is propelled by an internal-combustion or electric engine.
    - It is always over 100 feet in length.
    - It relies on wind for movement.
    - It is only used for racing.
    question_text: Which of the following best distinguishes a motorboat from other
      small watercraft?
  index: 139
  key_concept: motorboat
  name: motorboat
- aspects:
  - content: Motorboats are primarily classified as inboard or outboard based on how
      the engine is installed. Inboard motorboats have engines permanently mounted
      within the hull, with a drive shaft passing through to the propeller. Outboard
      motorboats feature portable, detachable engines that include the drive shaft
      and propeller, typically clamped to the stern. This distinction affects maintenance,
      maneuverability, and suitability for different environments.
    type: classification by engine installation
  - content: The two main hull types are displacement hulls, which push through water
      and are characterized by a V-shaped or round bottom, deep draft, and sharp bow;
      and planing hulls, which have a flat bottom and rise to skim across the water
      at higher speeds, reducing friction and resistance. Displacement hulls are suited
      for stability and carrying heavy loads, while planing hulls are optimized for
      speed.
    type: hull types and performance
  - content: Motorboats come in many forms, including runabouts (small open boats),
      cabin cruisers (with sleeping and cooking facilities), motor yachts (large cruisers
      for open waters), and specialized working boats like ferries, tugs, and police
      launches. Hydroplanes are designed for minimal water contact at high speeds.
      Additionally, auxiliary sailboats and motor sailers blend engine and sail propulsion
      for versatility in various conditions.
    type: varieties and specialized forms
  - content: 'The choice of motorboat type depends on intended use: outboard runabouts
      are favored for ease of transport and maintenance, cruisers for extended trips,
      and working boats for specific commercial or official functions. Hull type impacts
      performance in different water conditions, with planing hulls preferred for
      speed and displacement hulls for stability and rougher waters.'
