sections:
- aspects:
  - content: The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks,
      often described as a 'network of networks,' that enables computers worldwide
      to communicate and share information. It supports a vast array of uses, including
      communication, data sharing, and access to digital resources. The Internet is
      not a single entity but a collection of millions of private, public, academic,
      business, and government networks.
    type: Definition
  - content: Common uses of the Internet include email, social media, video and audio
      transmission, collaborative work, and access to the World Wide Web. It also
      supports the Internet of Things (IoT), where devices such as smartphones, appliances,
      and even entire cities are connected for data exchange and automation. E-businesses
      and e-commerce rely heavily on the Internet for transactions and services.
    type: Examples and Uses
  - content: The Internet has revolutionized mass communication, media, and commerce,
      making information accessible globally and enabling new forms of social and
      economic interaction. Its accessibility is nearly universal for individuals
      with a network connection, and by 2020, more than half the world's population
      had Internet access. The growth of smart technology and IoT continues to expand
      its reach and impact.

  index: 178
  key_concept: Definition and Scope of the Internet
  name: Internet
- aspects:
  - content: Robert Taylor was instrumental in the development of ARPANET, the early
      prototype of the Internet. Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn developed the Transmission
      Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), which became the foundational technology
      for the Internet. Cerf and Kahn are often credited as the principal inventors
      of the Internet.
    type: Historical Figures
  - content: ARPANET introduced the concept of host-to-host networking and packet
      switching, while TCP/IP enabled reliable data transmission across diverse networks.
      These innovations allowed for the scalability and interoperability that define
      the modern Internet.
    type: Technological Contributions
  - content: The Internet is the result of collaborative efforts by many individuals
      and organizations, not just a single inventor. The foundational work by Taylor,
      Cerf, and Kahn enabled the global expansion of the Internet and influenced subsequent
      developments in networking and communication technologies.
