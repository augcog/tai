sections:
- aspects:
  - content: A dinghy is defined as any of various small boats, which can be either
      rowboats or sailboats. The term encompasses a range of vessel types, from simple
      manually-powered boats to small sailing craft. In some contexts, the word 'dinghy'
      also refers to small, inflatable life rafts.
    type: Definition
  - content: Dinghies can be rowboats, sailboats, or powered boats. Common features
      include a pointed bow, transom stern, and round bottom, especially in powered
      variants. Racing dinghies are typically equipped with one or more sails, a rudder
      for steering, and sometimes a centreboard for stability and maneuverability.
      Inflatable dinghies are used as life rafts and are distinguished by their lightweight,
      portable construction.
    type: Types and Characteristics
  - content: 'Dinghies serve multiple purposes: in India, they are used to carry passengers
      or cargo along coastal and sheltered waters. Internationally, they often function
      as small ship''s boats, providing transport between ship and shore or other
      vessels. In recreational contexts, dinghies are popular for racing, requiring
      specialized equipment. Their use as life rafts highlights their importance in
      maritime safety.'
    type: Uses and Contexts
  - content: Examples of dinghies include traditional wooden rowboats used for short
      coastal trips, small sailing dinghies used in competitive racing, and inflatable
      dinghies carried as emergency life rafts on larger ships. The design and outfitting
      of a dinghy depend on its intended use, with racing dinghies often being lightweight
      and agile, while cargo dinghies prioritize stability and load capacity.
    type: Examples and Variations
  - content: The dinghy's versatility connects it to broader themes in maritime technology,
      recreation, and safety. Its design evolution reflects advances in materials
      and naval architecture. As both a practical tool for transport and a platform
      for sport, the dinghy illustrates how small craft can fulfill diverse roles.
      Its use as a life raft underscores its significance in emergency preparedness
      and survival at sea.
