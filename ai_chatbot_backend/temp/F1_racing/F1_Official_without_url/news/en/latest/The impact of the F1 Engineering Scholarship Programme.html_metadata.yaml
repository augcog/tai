  - content: The F1 Engineering Scholarship Programme is an initiative launched in
      2021 by Formula 1 to support students pursuing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering,
      and Mathematics) education. Its primary aim is to increase career opportunities
      for individuals from underrepresented groups within motorsport engineering and
      related fields. The programme is positioned as a vital effort to broaden access
      to technical careers in motorsport.
    type: Definition
  - content: Examples of the programme's impact include providing scholarships to
      students who might otherwise face financial or systemic barriers to entering
      engineering fields. By targeting underrepresented groups, such as women and
      ethnic minorities, the programme helps diversify the talent pipeline in F1 and
      related industries. Scholarship recipients often gain not only financial support
      but also mentorship and access to industry networks.
