      Championship, while teams compete for the Teams’ (Constructors’) Championship.
      Teamwork is crucial, as seen in pit stops where all four tires can be changed
      in under two seconds, but the spotlight often shines on drivers who must handle
      extreme g-forces and make split-second decisions at speeds exceeding 370 kph
      (230 mph).
    type: Team and Individual Competition
  - content: The F1 season consists of a series of races called Grands Prix, held
      at venues worldwide. The 2025 calendar features 24 Grand Prix weekends, including
      six Sprint events, stretching from March to December. The championship is highly
      prestigious, with significant prize money and global recognition for both drivers
      and teams.

      of precisely engineered parts, including detailed aerodynamic bodywork, suspension
      systems, turbo-hybrid power units, eight-speed paddle shift gearboxes, and 18-inch
      tires. The design focuses on maximizing speed, grip, and efficiency.
    type: Technical Composition
  - content: Modern F1 cars use advanced aerodynamics, acting like inverted airplanes.
      Front and rear wings, along with ground effect tunnels under the car, generate
      downforce, pressing the car onto the track for superior grip through corners.
      The 2022 technical regulations emphasize ground effect, with underfloor tunnels
      enhancing downforce and reducing 'dirty air,' allowing cars to follow each other
      more closely.
    type: Aerodynamics and Downforce
  - content: The combination of lightweight materials, sophisticated suspension, and
      advanced electronics enables F1 cars to accelerate, brake, and corner at extreme
      speeds. Drivers experience high g-forces and require exceptional skill to control
      the car at the limit, especially during overtaking and defending maneuvers.
