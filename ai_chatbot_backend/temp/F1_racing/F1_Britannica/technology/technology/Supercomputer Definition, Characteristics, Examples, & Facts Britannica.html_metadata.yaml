- aspects:
  - content: A supercomputer is a class of extremely powerful computers, typically
      representing the fastest high-performance systems available at any given time.
      The term is applied to machines capable of exceedingly high-speed computations,
      far surpassing the capabilities of standard computers. Supercomputers are distinguished
      by their ability to process vast amounts of data and execute complex calculations
      at remarkable speeds, measured in FLOPS (floating-point operations per second).
    type: definition
  - content: Supercomputers are primarily used for scientific and engineering tasks
      that require immense computational power. Common applications include climate
      and weather modeling, simulations of cosmic evolution, nuclear weapons and reactor
      design, pharmaceutical compound research, cryptology, and market research. Notable
      examples include the Cray-1, IBM's Deep Blue, and the Blue Gene series. Their
      use has expanded from national security and scientific research to business
      analytics and even online gaming infrastructure.
    type: applications and examples
  - content: The evolution of supercomputers has driven advances in multiple disciplines
      by enabling simulations and analyses that were previously impossible. Their
      ability to model complex systems has significant implications for meteorology,
      medicine, aerospace, and national security. As costs declined in the 1990s,
      supercomputers became accessible to a wider range of organizations, influencing
      both academic research and commercial sectors. The continued development of
      supercomputers is closely linked to progress in fields like artificial intelligence
      and big data analytics.

    question_text: Which of the following best describes a supercomputer?
  index: 167
  key_concept: supercomputer
  name: supercomputer
- aspects:
  - content: Supercomputers are characterized by several technical features that set
      them apart from conventional computers. They typically contain multiple central
      processing units (CPUs), often numbering in the thousands or more, to achieve
      high computational rates. These CPUs are interconnected to allow parallel processing,
      overcoming the physical limitations of circuit speed, such as the speed of light.
      Supercomputers also possess large storage capacities and extremely fast input/output
      (I/O) systems to handle the massive data flows required for their tasks.
    type: technical characteristics
  - content: A key distinguishing feature is the use of vector arithmetic, which enables
      supercomputers to operate on entire lists (vectors) of numbers simultaneously,
      rather than processing one pair of numbers at a time. This allows for much faster
      computations in applications like scientific simulations or financial modeling.
      Additionally, supercomputers employ parallel processing architectures, distributing
      workloads across multiple CPUs to maximize efficiency and speed.
    type: vector arithmetic and parallelism
  - content: To support their high speeds, supercomputers utilize innovations such
      as miniaturized circuit components, reduced wiring lengths, and advanced cooling
      techniques, including cryogenic fluids. These design choices are necessary to
      approach the fundamental physical limits of electronic signal transmission.
      The combination of large memory, fast I/O, and parallel/vector processing allows
      supercomputers to solve problems that are intractable for ordinary computers,
      making them indispensable for fields like weather forecasting, cryptography,
      and large-scale simulations.

- aspects:
  - content: The development of supercomputers was heavily influenced by Seymour Cray,
      who worked at Engineering Research Associates, Control Data Corporation, and
      later founded Cray Research and Cray Computer Corporation. Cray's innovations,
      such as the CDC 1604 and CDC 6600, set performance benchmarks and introduced
      the term 'supercomputer.' Companies like IBM and NEC also played significant
      roles, with IBM's Stretch and NEC's Earth Simulator marking important milestones.

  - content: Supercomputing architecture evolved from single-processor designs to
      include multiprocessing and massively parallel processing. Cray's machines,
      such as the Cray-1 and Cray X-MP, introduced vector processing and parallelism,
      while W. Daniel Hillis's Connection Machines pioneered distributed control and
      massively parallel architectures using thousands of simple processors. The shift
      from custom hardware to commodity processors enabled broader access and scalability.
    type: architectural innovations
  - content: Key historical systems include the CDC 6600, Cray-1, Cray-2, Connection
      Machine CM-2, IBM's Deep Blue, and the Blue Gene/L series. These machines broke
      successive performance records, moving from millions to billions to trillions
      of FLOPS. Landmark achievements include Deep Blue's victory over Garry Kasparov
      and the first petaflop system, IBM's Roadrunner. The evolution of supercomputers
      has been driven by both military and scientific needs, with applications expanding
