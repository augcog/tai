## üöÄ Quick Start

TAI uses project-specific virtual environments with automatic activation. Each project has its own dependencies and setup.

### Prerequisites

#### 1. Install Poetry

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

#### 2. Install direnv for automatic environment activation

```bash
# On macOS with Homebrew
brew install direnv

# On Linux with apt
sudo apt install direnv
```

#### 3. Add direnv hook to your shell

```bash
# For zsh
echo 'eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# For bash
echo 'eval "$(direnv hook bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Setup Projects

Navigate to each project directory to set up and use. Each project has its own README with detailed instructions:

#### AI Chatbot Backend

```bash
cd ai_course_bot/ai_chatbot_backend
direnv allow  # Allow automatic environment activation
# Follow instructions in ai_course_bot/ai_chatbot_backend/README.md
```

#### RAG Pipeline

```bash
cd rag
direnv allow  # Allow automatic environment activation
# Follow instructions in rag/README.md
```

### Recommended vscode setting for editor Cursor/VScode:

Create a folder .vscode if not exist. Create settings.json inside the folder and change
to This:

```JSON
{
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "files.exclude": {
        "**/__pycache__": true,
        "**/.pytest_cache": true,
        "**/.mypy_cache": true,
        "**/.ruff_cache": true,
        "**/*.egg-info": true,
        "**/.classpath": true,
        "**/.project": true,
        "**/.settings": true,
        "**/.factorypath": true
    },
    "files.insertFinalNewline": true,
    "files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true,
    "isort.args": [
        "--settings-path",
        "${workspaceFolder}"
    ],
    "isort.check": true,
    "isort.importStrategy": "fromEnvironment",
    "python.analysis.inlayHints.callArgumentNames": "all",
    "python.analysis.inlayHints.functionReturnTypes": true,
    "python.analysis.inlayHints.variableTypes": true,
    "python.testing.pytestEnabled": true,
    "python.testing.unittestEnabled": false,
    "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "${workspaceFolder}/ai_course_bot/ai_chatbot_backend/.venv/bin/python",
    "python.terminal.activateEnvironment": false,

    "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
        "./ai_course_bot/ai_chatbot_backend/app",
        "./rag"
    ],

    "search.exclude": {
        "**/node_modules": true,
        "**/.venv": true,
        "**/*.egg-info": true,
        "**/__pycache__": true
    },

    "[python]": {
        "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
            "source.organizeImports": "explicit"
        },
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "ms-python.black-formatter",
        "editor.rulers": [
            120
        ]
    }
}
```

NOTE: need to install `ms-python.black-formatter` extension in the editor.

That's it! Each project will automatically activate its environment when you enter the directory.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

TAI is organized as a modular monorepo with independent project environments:

```
tai/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üöÄ ai_course_bot/ai_chatbot_backend/  # FastAPI backend service
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .venv/                           # Project-specific virtual environment
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml                   # Poetry dependencies
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Makefile                         # Project commands
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .envrc                           # Auto-activation with direnv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üß† rag/                              # RAG pipeline and file processing
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .venv/                           # Project-specific virtual environment
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml                   # Poetry dependencies
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Makefile                         # Project commands
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .envrc                           # Auto-activation with direnv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ rag/file_organizer/               # File organization utilities
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìä evaluation/dataset_generate/      # Evaluation and dataset tools
```

## üîÑ How It Works

1. **Navigate** to a project: `cd ai_course_bot/ai_chatbot_backend`
2. **Environment activates** automatically via direnv
3. **Use project commands**: `make help` to see available commands
4. **VSCode detects** the correct Python interpreter automatically

## What is TAI?

TAI is an open source project developed by researchers and students at UC Berkeley (see Credits below), with the goal to offer the power of edge GPT models and services for education purposes. The GPT models selected in TAI are carefully curated to allow students to easily spin up their own local GPT services and websites. The project further develops robust embedding and RAG toolkits to allow users to convert their knowledge base and multimedia documents into searchable vector databases.

Once installed locally, TAI allows individuals to easily start a conversation to use GPT techniques to search through local documents using simple natural languages.

## Core Algorithms

Llama3 as base model, BGE-M3 as embedding model, Sqlite-vss as vector database, and RAG agent.

## AI Course Bot

AI course bot is our Open-Source RAG Framework, designed to facilitate the creation and deployment of a TAI website. This platform harnesses the power of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to provide answers to questions sourced from course materials and online resources. With its user-friendly deployment process and customization options, the TAI serves as a valuable resource for providing seamless support to students.

## RAG

To ready the vector database for the RAG system, a web scraper is employed to extract online documentation. The obtained data, which comes in various formats, is subsequently divided into segments. These segments are then embedded and stored within the vector database to ensure efficient retrieval by the TA Agent.

## Evaluation

The TAI project is equipped with a comprehensive test suite that ensures the reliability and accuracy of the system. The tests are designed to evaluate the functionality of the core algorithms, including the Llama3 model, BGE-M3 embedding model, and Sqlite-vss vector database. By running these evaluations, users can verify the performance of the TAI system and identify any potential issues that may arise during operation.
