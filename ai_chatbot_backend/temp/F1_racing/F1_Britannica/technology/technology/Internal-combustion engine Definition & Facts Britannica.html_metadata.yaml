sections:
- aspects:
  - content: An internal-combustion engine is a type of device in which the reactants
      of combustion (oxidizer and fuel) and the products of combustion serve as the
      working fluids. The engine derives its energy from the heat released during
      the combustion of the fuel-oxidizer mixture, which occurs within the engine
      itself as part of its thermodynamic cycle. This distinguishes internal-combustion
      engines from external-combustion engines, where combustion occurs outside the
      working fluid.
    type: Definition
  - content: Examples of internal-combustion engines include gasoline engines, diesel
      engines, gas-turbine engines, and rocket-propulsion systems. Each of these utilizes
      the fundamental principle of combusting fuel within the engine to generate hot
      gases that perform mechanical work.
    type: Examples
  - content: The hot gaseous products of combustion act on moving surfaces such as
      pistons, turbine blades, or nozzles to generate useful work. This direct conversion
      of chemical energy to mechanical work makes internal-combustion engines highly
      efficient for mobile and compact power generation, contributing to their widespread
      use in transportation and industry.
    type: Practical Implications
  - content: Internal-combustion engines are central to the fields of thermodynamics
      and mechanical engineering. Their operation involves principles of energy conversion,
      heat transfer, and fluid dynamics. They are contrasted with external-combustion
      engines like steam engines, where energy transfer to the working fluid occurs
      via heat exchangers.

    explanation: Internal-combustion engines perform combustion inside the engine,
      using the resulting hot gases to do work. This distinguishes them from external-combustion
      engines, where combustion is separate from the working fluid.
    options:
    - Combustion occurs outside the engine, heating a separate working fluid.
    - Combustion occurs within the engine, and the products of combustion directly
      perform work.
    - The engine uses only electricity to generate motion.
    - The engine relies on external heat exchangers to transfer energy.
    question_text: Which of the following best describes the working principle of
      an internal-combustion engine?
  index: 149
  key_concept: Definition and Working Principle
  name: internal-combustion engine
- aspects:
  - content: 'Internal-combustion engines are classified into two main groups: continuous-combustion
      engines and intermittent-combustion engines. The distinction is based on how
      fuel and oxidizer are introduced and how combustion occurs within the engine.'
    type: Definition
  - content: Continuous-combustion engines, such as jet engines and gas turbines,
      maintain a steady flow of fuel and oxidizer with a stable flame. Intermittent-combustion
      engines, such as gasoline piston engines and diesel engines, operate in cycles
      with periodic ignition and combustion events.
    type: Examples
  - content: Continuous-combustion engines are often used in aviation and power generation
      due to their ability to produce sustained thrust or power. Intermittent-combustion
      engines are widely used in automobiles, trucks, and other vehicles where cyclic
      operation is suitable for variable load and speed.
    type: Use Cases
  - content: The type of internal-combustion engine used affects efficiency, emissions,
      and suitability for specific applications. For example, jet engines are optimized
      for high-speed, high-altitude flight, while piston engines are more adaptable
      for ground vehicles.

    explanation: Gas turbines are examples of continuous-combustion engines, while
      diesel engines are intermittent-combustion engines. Gasoline piston engines
      are also intermittent, and jet engines are continuous.
    options:
    - Continuous-combustion engine – gasoline piston engine
    - Intermittent-combustion engine – jet engine
    - Continuous-combustion engine – gas turbine
    - Intermittent-combustion engine – diesel engine
    question_text: Which of the following pairs correctly matches the engine type
      with an example?
  index: 149
  key_concept: Types of Internal-Combustion Engines
  name: internal-combustion engine
- aspects:
  - content: The operation of internal-combustion engines can be described in terms
      of thermodynamic events or cycles. In continuous-combustion engines, these events
      occur simultaneously, while in intermittent-combustion engines, they occur in
      succession and repeat with each cycle.
    type: Definition
  - content: In a four-stroke gasoline engine, the cycle includes intake, compression,
      combustion (power), and exhaust strokes. In gas turbines, air and fuel are continuously
      compressed, combusted, and expanded to produce work.
    type: Examples
  - content: Understanding the thermodynamic cycles is crucial for analyzing engine
      efficiency, power output, and emissions. The cycles are governed by the laws
      of thermodynamics, particularly the conservation of energy and the increase
      of entropy.
    type: Connections
  - content: The nature of the thermodynamic cycle impacts engine design, fuel efficiency,
      and environmental performance. For instance, optimizing the compression ratio
      in a piston engine can improve thermal efficiency but may require higher octane
      fuels.
    type: Implications
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: In intermittent-combustion engines, thermodynamic events such as
      intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust occur in a repeating sequence for
      each cycle, unlike the simultaneous processes in continuous-combustion engines.
    options:
    - They occur simultaneously and continuously.
    - They occur in succession and repeat with each cycle.
    - They do not involve combustion.
    - They only occur during engine startup.

  key_concept: Thermodynamic Operation and Cycles
  name: internal-combustion engine
- aspects:
  - content: Internal-combustion engines perform combustion within the engine, using
      the products of combustion as the working fluid. In contrast, external-combustion
      engines, such as steam engines, combust fuel outside the working fluid, which
      is then heated via a heat exchanger.
    type: Definition
  - content: Steam engines are classic examples of external-combustion engines, where
      water is heated externally to produce steam that drives pistons or turbines.
      Internal-combustion engines include gasoline, diesel, and jet engines.
    type: Examples
  - content: Internal-combustion engines generally offer higher efficiency and more
      compact designs for mobile applications, while external-combustion engines can
      use a wider variety of fuels and are often used in stationary power plants.
    type: Implications
  - content: The distinction between internal and external combustion is fundamental
      in thermodynamics and mechanical engineering, influencing engine design, fuel
      choice, and application domains.
