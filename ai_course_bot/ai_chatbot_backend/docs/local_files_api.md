# Local File Retrieval API - System Design Document

## 1. Overview

The Local File Retrieval API provides a robust, scalable interface for accessing files stored locally within the system. This document outlines the architecture, design decisions, API specifications, and implementation roadmap.

## 2. Architectural Layers

The system follows a clean, layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
┌───────────────────┐
│   API Router      │  FastAPI endpoints for file listing and retrieval
├───────────────────┤
│   Service Layer   │  Business logic for file operations
├───────────────────┤
│   Storage Layer   │  File system interaction with the local directory structure
└───────────────────┘
```

### 2.1 API Router Layer
- Handles HTTP requests and responses
- Input validation and error handling
- Authentication and authorization checks
- Routes requests to appropriate service methods

### 2.2 Service Layer
- Contains core business logic for file operations
- Implements file listing, metadata extraction, and retrieval functionality
- Provides abstractions over the storage layer
- Handles error cases and exceptions

### 2.3 Storage Layer
- Interacts directly with the file system
- Manages the physical organization of files
- Handles file I/O operations
- Provides a structured directory hierarchy

## 3. API Specification

### 3.1 Endpoints

#### List Files
```
GET /api/v1/local-files
```
Lists all files with metadata from the configured data directory.

**Query Parameters:**
- `directory` (optional): Filter files by specific directory

**Response:**
```json
{
  "files": [
    {
      "file_name": "example.pdf",
      "mime_type": "application/pdf",
      "size_bytes": 204800,
      "modified_time": "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z",
      "file_path": "documents/example.pdf",
      "directory": "documents"
    }
  ],
  "total_count": 1
}
```

#### Retrieve File
```
GET /api/v1/local-files/{file_path:path}
```
Retrieves and streams a specific file.

**Path Parameters:**
- `file_path`: Path to the file, relative to the base data directory

**Response:**
- File content with appropriate Content-Type header
- 404 Not Found if file doesn't exist
- 403 Forbidden if access is denied

## 4. File Storage Organization

Files are organized in a structured directory hierarchy:

```
data/
├── documents/   - Text files, PDFs, documents
├── videos/      - Video files (MP4, AVI, etc.)
├── audios/      - Audio files (MP3, WAV, etc.)
└── others/      - Other file types
```

This structure:
- Improves organization and discoverability
- Makes it easier to apply type-specific handling
- Enables more granular access control
- Facilitates future extension with specialized subdirectories

## 5. Library Evaluation

### 5.1 File System Handling
| Library | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|---------|------|------|----------|
| **pathlib** (built-in) | Standard library, object-oriented paths, cross-platform | No async support | ✅ Selected for simplicity and reliability |
| **aiofiles** | Async file operations, non-blocking I/O | Additional dependency, only needed for high-concurrency | 🔄 Future consideration |
| **os.path** (built-in) | Simple, standard library | String-based, not object-oriented | ❌ Prefer pathlib |

### 5.2 File Delivery & Streaming
| Library | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|---------|------|------|----------|
| **FastAPI.FileResponse** | Built-in, optimized streaming, automatic MIME typing | Limited customization | ✅ Selected for integration with FastAPI |
| **aiohttp** | Async streaming capabilities | Additional dependency, complex setup | ❌ Not necessary for MVP |

### 5.3 MIME Type Detection
| Library | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|---------|------|------|----------|
| **mimetypes** (built-in) | Standard library, no dependencies | Limited detection capabilities | ✅ Selected for simplicity |
| **python-magic** | More accurate type detection | External dependency, libmagic requirement | 🔄 Future consideration |

## 6. Testing Strategy

### 6.1 Unit Tests
- Test service functions in isolation
- Mock file system interactions
- Validate error handling and edge cases

### 6.2 Integration Tests
- Test API endpoints with TestClient
- Validate response formats and status codes
- Test with real file system in a controlled test directory

### 6.3 Test Cases
1. List files (empty directory, multiple files, nested directories)
2. List files with directory filter
3. Retrieve existing file (various types)
4. Attempt to retrieve non-existent file
5. Attempt to access files outside the allowed directory
6. Authentication tests

## 7. Security Considerations

1. **Path Traversal Prevention**: Validate all paths to ensure they're within the allowed directory
2. **Authentication**: Require authentication for all endpoints
3. **File Type Validation**: Consider validating file types against an allowed list
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement to prevent DoS attacks

## 8. Iterative Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP (Current Implementation)
- Basic file listing functionality
- File retrieval with proper Content-Type
- Directory organization
- Path security validation

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- Improved MIME type detection
- File metadata extraction (for PDFs, etc.)
- Pagination for file listings
- Basic search capabilities

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization
- Add caching layer (Redis)
- Implement asynchronous file operations
- Performance monitoring and optimization

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- File content indexing
- Full-text search
- Thumbnail generation for images/docs
- Advanced file metadata extraction

## 9. Extensibility Considerations

The design enables several future extensions:
- Content-based search using embeddings
- Integration with document processing pipelines
- Cloud storage backends
- File versioning and change tracking

This architecture is designed to scale from simple file retrieval to a comprehensive document management system as requirements evolve.
