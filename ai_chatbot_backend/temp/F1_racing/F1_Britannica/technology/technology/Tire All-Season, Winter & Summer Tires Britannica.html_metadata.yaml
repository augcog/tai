  question_type: recap
sections:
- aspects:
  - content: A tire is a continuous band that encircles the rim of a wheel, forming
      a tread that rolls on a road, track, or ground. Its primary function is to provide
      a surface for the wheel to roll on, contributing to the vehicle's movement and
      performance. Tires are essential components in vehicles, affecting ride comfort,
      traction, and safety.
    type: definition
  - content: Examples of tires include those used on automobiles, bicycles, trucks,
      buses, airplanes, and railroad cars. Each application may require different
      tire types and designs to meet specific performance and safety requirements.
      For instance, railroad cars use metal tires for low rolling resistance, while
      automobiles use rubber tires for better friction and cushioning.
    type: examples
  - content: The design and material of a tire have significant implications for vehicle
      efficiency, safety, and environmental impact. Proper tire selection and maintenance
      are crucial for optimal vehicle performance, fuel efficiency, and accident prevention.
      Tires also connect to broader topics such as transportation technology, materials
      science, and environmental sustainability.

    explanation: The tire's main function is to encircle the rim and provide a tread
      for rolling and traction. The other options either describe unrelated functions
      or misrepresent the tire's role.
    options:
    - To provide a decorative finish to the wheel
    - To encircle the rim and form a tread that enables rolling and traction
    - To act as the main braking system of the vehicle
    - To serve as the engine's primary support structure
    question_text: Which of the following best describes the primary function of a
      tire on a vehicle?
  index: 151
  key_concept: tire
  name: tire
- aspects:
  - content: Tires are broadly classified into metal and rubber types. Metal tires,
      typically made of iron or steel, are used on vehicles like railroad cars for
      their low rolling resistance, strength, and durability. Rubber tires, which
      include both solid and pneumatic variants, are used on most free-moving vehicles
      due to their higher friction and cushioning properties.
    type: definition and classification
  - content: Metal tires are mainly used for vehicles running on smooth rails, such
      as trains, where low rolling resistance is prioritized. Rubber tires are preferred
      for vehicles that require more friction for turning, climbing, and braking,
      such as cars and airplanes. Within rubber tires, solid tires are used in environments
      prone to cuts or punctures, while pneumatic tires are chosen for their superior
      cushioning and performance on roads.
    type: use cases and performance
  - content: The choice between metal and rubber tires affects vehicle performance,
      maintenance, and suitability for specific environments. For example, the durability
      of metal tires is advantageous for railroads, while the adaptability of rubber
      tires makes them essential for diverse road conditions. This classification
      also reflects technological evolution in transportation.
    type: implications and context

    correct_answer:

    explanation: Rubber tires are chosen for automobiles because they offer the necessary
      friction and cushioning for safe and effective turning, climbing, accelerating,
      and braking. The other options are either incorrect or not the primary reason
      for this preference.
    options:
    - Rubber tires are less expensive to manufacture
    - Rubber tires provide higher friction and cushioning needed for turning and braking
    - Metal tires are illegal on all vehicles
    - Rubber tires are lighter than metal tires in all cases
    question_text: What is a key reason why rubber tires are preferred over metal
      tires for automobiles?
  index: 268
  key_concept: Types of tires
  name: Types of tires
- aspects:
  - content: Solid tires, also known as cushion tires, are made entirely of rubber
      and do not contain air. The rubber portion of these tires carries the load,
      absorbs shocks, and resists cutting and abrasion. They are often adhered directly
      to the wheel or to a metal band on the wheel's periphery.
    type: definition and structure
  - content: Solid rubber tires were introduced in 1881 on London hansom cabs and
      were once common on many road vehicles. However, their use on highways declined
      due to legislation aimed at reducing road damage, and they were largely replaced
      by pneumatic tires for most road applications. Today, solid tires are primarily
      used on industrial trucks, tractors, and carts.
    type: historical context and evolution
  - content: Solid tires are advantageous in environments where the risk of tire cuts
      or punctures is high, such as in industrial or agricultural settings. However,
      they provide less cushioning and comfort than pneumatic tires, making them unsuitable
      for most highway vehicles. Their durability and resistance to damage make them
      ideal for slow-moving, heavy-duty applications.
    type: practical implications and edge cases
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: Solid tires are now mainly used on industrial trucks, tractors, and
      carts where durability and resistance to cuts or punctures are critical. They
      are not suitable for highway vehicles or high-speed applications due to their
      lack of cushioning.
    options:
    - On passenger cars for highway driving
    - On industrial trucks and farm carts where puncture risk is high
    - On high-speed airplanes
    - On bicycles for racing
    question_text: In which scenario are solid tires most commonly used today?
  index: 276
  key_concept: Solid tires
  name: Solid tires
- aspects:
  - content: Pneumatic tires are flexible covers with an impermeable lining designed
      to contain compressed air, which carries the load and absorbs shocks. The rubber
      tread provides traction, resists wear, and protects against punctures. Unlike
      solid tires, pneumatic tires rely entirely on air pressure for their load-bearing
      and shock-absorbing capabilities.
    type: definition and function
  - content: The first pneumatic tire patent was issued to Robert William Thomson
      in 1845, but the concept was largely forgotten until John Boyd Dunlop revived
      it for bicycles in 1888. Pneumatic tires were adapted for motor vehicles by
      Michelin, and the design evolved to include inner tubes and later tubeless,
      radial-ply structures, which are now standard.
    type: historical development
  - content: Pneumatic tires are designed to achieve low rolling resistance, low vertical
      stiffness (for ride comfort), high sliding friction (for safety in wet and dry
      conditions), high longitudinal and lateral stiffness (to minimize sliding in
      the contact patch), and resistance to wear and damage. These goals are met through
      careful selection of materials, cord reinforcement, and tread design.
    type: design features and performance goals
  - content: Pneumatic tires are used on almost all free-moving vehicles due to their
      superior cushioning and adaptability. They are retained on wheels with wire
      beads and inflated to specific pressures depending on the application. Their
      widespread use—over 200 million manufactured annually for motor vehicles—demonstrates
      their importance in modern transportation.
    type: practical implications and usage
  check_in_question:
    correct_answer:
    - 1
    explanation: Pneumatic tires became standard because they offer superior cushioning
      and adaptability compared to solid tires, leading to better ride comfort, handling,
      and safety. Cost and maintenance are not the primary reasons.
    options:
    - They are cheaper to produce than solid tires
    - They provide greater cushioning and adaptability, improving ride comfort and
      safety
    - They are more resistant to fire
    - They require no maintenance
